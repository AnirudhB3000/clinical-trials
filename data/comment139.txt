I will say I did have a doc tell me not to get my booster (just yet) about end of October, but it was really because I was dealing with pretty bad daily hive/rash activity. The flu shot made them worse around that time. Was vaccinated late 2020/early 2021. He basically said delta wasn’t evading vaccines so I should feel comfortable with the protect my previous vaccination gave me. 

However, I did get my booster the second my rashes were calmed down after the flu shot event and I felt comfortable with it in early December. I wouldn’t even classify it as a doc saying don’t get a vaccine though.
