>I told another coworker that unfortunately the flu vaccination cannot protect her from SARS-CoV-2. 

Yep, I had a nurse tell me that my mom was protected because she'd gotten her flu vaccine. Uh, no. Not at all. I just about lost my shit because that nurse is a BSN and is in the process of getting her master's. She's also an adjunct prof at a nursing school. She's a GREAT nurse, but she's still wrong.
