I saw a comment elsewhere on reddit by a user who was discussing an upcoming Ivermectin trial.  The user stated something to the effect of: "If the study finds that Ivermectin is not an effective treatment for Covid-19 then the study is wrong, flawed, and I will not believe it." That is your answer unfortunately.
