In 21 yrs of ER- never seen it. 
Medical issues are usually fairly easy to distinguish from anxiety. 
Seen plenty of people initially treated (usually by paramedics or triage- who have less time and equipment to evaluate) as having asthma or anaphylaxis and other things who clearly were having a panic attack.
