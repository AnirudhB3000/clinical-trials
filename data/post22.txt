[31M] Attempting to work through an inguinal hernia, looking into clinical trials as an option, would love advice! Hello there!  


I'm a 31 year old male who has just been diagnosed with an inguinal hernia. My last doctor sent me to the ER to ensure it wasn't incarcerated or strangulated, but is protruding around 2 inches or so internally, with no noticeable bulge externally. Apparently I've had this for a while, but I've been working an office job the last few years and didn't really notice too much discomfort outside of strained coughing/laughing/heavy lifting. I've recently gone back to work for a much more laborious job which involves a lot of lifting unfortunately and now I'm constantly in discomfort. I'm looking for a few options and would love some advice.  


Unfortunately, my current health insurance won't kick in until after April and it doesn't seem beneficial to keep working through my work responsibilities, as I feel like it's making it worse in the long run. I live in the Orange County area and I've noticed there's a place that does clinical trials in Anaheim nearby:

Does anyone here have any experience with something like this? They're offering the surgery at no cost, with a small stipend as well. Is there a serious risk in taking this approach, or am I better off trying to work as lightly as possible for the next 3+ months until my insurance is reinstated? Any help would be appreciated, thanks everyone!
