Stage3c Ovarian Cancer - Diagnosed 1/3/2018.  NED 6/1/2018.  Recurrence 2 regional tumors <4cm 5/1/2019

First Round Treatment: Partial Debulking/Carboplatin/Paclitaxel/Bevicizumab/Atezolizumab    

Second Round Treatment: Carboplatin/Doxil (PARP inhibitor coming if response isn't good)

**Question**

Need advice on finding clinical trials for my wife’s treatment of Ovarian Cancer.   Originally diagnosed stage 3c with partial debulking surgery, she went four months on carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevicuzumab and found no evidence of disease in June of 2018. She also was on a trial for atezolizumab.

Recurrence was found in May of 2019 with two tumors in small bowel.  Treatment is carboplatin and doxil with no surgery.  We’re in Ohio and had a second opinion on treatment (carboplatin/doxil) from Memorial Sloan Kettering and they are in agreement with her oncologist. MSK Onc did say however that we may be able to find a clinical trial that’s targeted specifically at genetics of her disease (eg tumor has BRCA mutation but her germline genetics do not). I just have no idea how to do that.

Is this something we can hire someone to help with? Any advice would be appreciated!
