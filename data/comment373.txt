What are you talking about?  I've answered that multiple times now, and it's directly stated multiple times in that article.  Here, I copied the first sentence that states it:  "The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days."

No one argues that risk of spread is multifactorial, that's the case with all illness?  Either way, as I already stated, asymptomatic transmission is very well demonstrated in this illness, and you're not really arguing against it.  Your responses are really bizarre to me, neither scientifically nor logically grounded, and are moving in an inexplicable direction, so this is likely the last time I engage you.
