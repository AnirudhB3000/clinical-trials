Staph help 32 white male 205 lbs 6’1 no drugs or meds and  don’t drink. 

Am I treating this right? I started with what I thought was a zit or bite on July 2 and realized it was Staph on the 3’rd after it started to spread. Ended up up with three sores total on my thighs. I’ve kept them covered and they haven’t spread anymore. I’ve been treating them daily by cleaning them thoroughly with pure alcohol, applying medihoney (which showed to treat staph and mrsa in clinical trials), and then covering them with nexcare bandages with keep them very sealed. Anything else I should be doing?
