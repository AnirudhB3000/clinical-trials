The US FDA, for good or ill, routinely and nearly always declines to accept foreign approvals for any foreign diagnostic test, drug, therapeutic, or medical device. They always require their own testing first. As far as I can figure, CDC assumed that obtaining FDA clearance would be just as slow either way.

This is par for the course for CDC and FDA. The kneejerk regulatory nature of this is to reject first and ask questions later, and it bit us in the face. 

You've got to be kidding that you really think our hotheaded Germphobe-in-chief created some conspiracy about this. Guys. Try to keep your heads on, we all have to deal with this.
