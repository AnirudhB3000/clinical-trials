Completely new to the concept of clinical trials and wanting to learn more. Where to begin? Hi all!

I am trying to learn from the ground up about the clinical trial industry, specifically people who host clinical trials. Where would you recommend I begin?

Also is there anyone well known in this space who is blogging or being open about the industry I should follow? Appreciate any insight and thank you in advance!!
