Is Mebendalole safe to take for a breastfeeding mom?  

I am an American currently living in a developing country \[doctors are useless here\]. My wife is breastfeeding our 4-month-old son.

Everyone here takes worm medicine every 6 months for worms.

I could not find a USA-based clinical trial for this drug, I read studies from other countries saying the drug barely secretes in breast milk. Is it safe for her to take this drug? At how many milligrams? 

The options are Mebendazole or a tablet \[Zentar Plus\] which contains Albendazole 400mg, and Ivermectin 6mg.
