On Descovy.com it is advertised that Descovy for PrEP had 8 seroconvert out of 2,670 people. Giving it a 99.7% efficacy rate or 0.3% failure rate in clinical trials. Iâ€™m all about statistics and trying to understand on a deeper level to relax my anxiety. I did my tree diagram and found one of the branches leads to infection. How well do clinical trials apply to real life?

A study calculated a recently positive top has a 37.18% chance of infecting his bottom partner.

So 0.3718 (chance for bottom) x 0.003 (fail rate of Descovy)= 0.1115% chance for bottom to get infected assuming no condom. Can I not use this math to figure out my probability or is it much more complex than a mathematical formula? 

Can a doctor or statistician explain to me further?
