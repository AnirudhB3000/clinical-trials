I have been invited to participate in a Clinical Trial/Study in a few weeks time. From what I've heard/researched, Australian clinical trials are known for being well-regulated and heavily monitored by ethics committees.

Below is a few screenshots from the briefing which explain which drugs are being tested. If anyone requires the full document or more information feel free to PM me.

I was hoping somebody could explain to me the dangers of participating in such a trial, and hopefully give some advice regarding my participation. I was thinking of taking the full debriefing to an experienced General Practitioner.

Which questions should I be asking the organisation specifically?

Hope somebody can provide some assistance, Thanks!
