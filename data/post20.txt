Clinical drug trial - please help me out I am a healthy volunteer 21/F going to be taking part in a clinical trial for a fibrosis. this will be 1 dose via IV of a study drug. Can someone knowledgeable help me understnad how other fibrosis drugs currently on the market work in the body? Like, do they target specific organs or symptoms? What class of drug could this be, like a painkiller, anti-inflamatory, etc? Obviously the drug company gave an overview, but I want to get info from ppl not connected to the study.
