Is taking medicine for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis when you don't need it dangerous ? 22M, \~140lbl. caucasian. Clinical study is in Osaka (JP).

Context : I want to make easy money with clinical trials, there will be a full screening including blood tests, electrocardiography, Fecal occult blood test. Then 1 week stay at the hospital and finally a follow up examination. I'll get more info during the screening, but I learned that I will try medicine for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. I'm just wondering if that can fuck me up long term, what are the dangers/risks and should I proceed for easy money? They say that "The purpose of the trial is to get efficacy data in comparison to that of Japanese males.".
