I live in western New York state, 2 counties away from Monroe county, which has the first confirmed case in this part of the state.


My daughter in nursing school has had all clinicals cancelled, online classes only. 


The tiny community hospital I am currently on contract with suspended nursing clinicals before the colleges cancelled them. Proactive, amirite?


Same hospital now has the facility's stock of masks locked up and accessible only by the RN supervisor, very limited supply in clinical areas, and none available for the snatch-and-grab crowd in public areas.


Other than that, it seems to be business as usual. No emergency plan that has been issued as yet. Since I float anywhere from ED to ICU to inpatient, I have asked in each department. No plan in place.


Frustrating.
