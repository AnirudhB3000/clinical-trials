Why do blood tests feel awesome? Hey! I'm brand new to Reddit so apologies if I'm posting in an incorrect format or something - not quite sure how this all works yet.

I'm a 23 year old male, 62kg, 168cm. I don't take any regular medications nor do I smoke. 

Over the last few years, I've found myself enjoying blood tests more and more. The feeling of the needle is often pleasurable, which seems so strange to think about, although that's not my main focus. I'm currently taking part in a clinical trial, and as you'd expect they've inserted a cannula. I'm loving the feeling of the blood draining from my arm each time, and really looking forward to the next one in half an hour or so! When it happens its so satisfying. Almost like having a real good poo (HAHA).

BUT WHY ON EARTH AM I ENJOYING THIS??

Thanks :)
