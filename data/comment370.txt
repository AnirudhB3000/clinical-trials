Median days doesn't seem to be useful here?  Given that another test that no one is performing is how long every patient is shedding, the maximum would need to be considered, rather than a measure of central tendency, unless that max was shown to be a wild outlier.  And I would argue that asymptomatic carriers spread infection.  I'm curious why you would argue otherwise?  It's known that people who haven't shown symptoms have spread it, though, granted, this was prior to them developing symptoms rather than after release from the hospital.  It's why China was quarantining patients for another two weeks post-release.
