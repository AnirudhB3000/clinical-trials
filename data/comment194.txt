well, theres a few in different fields. I've spoken to one of the scientists that was involved in the Manhatten Project, the countries top nuclear engineer who had responsibility of safety testing nuclear reactors to find the highest limits they could work at (I was contacting him in relation to an innovation to help turn a nuclear plant from a base-load power station to peaking power plant, which would need the use of TES storage in the middle of the cycle, and this is now being pursued by an independent team), a neuroscientist with some comparatively well known books in the field of consciousness, plus my family is full of scientists. Another scientist that was trained by Harry Kroto (but to be fair, he reported Kroto was a pain) and so forth. A number in energy and in biology / microbiology that tutored me.

Generally I find them easy to talk to, as long as you get what they are saying and ask intelligent things so they will give you intelligent answers, the best in my experience tend to be high in openness and say things you wouldn't expect off the record.
