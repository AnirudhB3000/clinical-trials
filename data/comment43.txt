> But I feel the same as you; the more thorough, the better.

IANAD, but I've had panic attacks and long periods of successive attacks lined up like kids at a candy store handing out free candy...I would say that one of the fundamental things that helped me (among a few others) was to know there was nothing wrong with me physically. I was able to understand that I was feeling was something I could control...rather than feel victim to the feelings, or worse, feel even MORE out of control.
