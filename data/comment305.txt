Well, remember, it was a medical doctor in the UK who went on record with his research to say that vaccines cause autism.  Thankfully said doctor also had his license revoked for that, but to this day the damage lingers.  Ignorance can happen to anyone with any level of education, as can greed and corruption.  The best thing is to just keep sharing truth, concern, and empathy where we can.
