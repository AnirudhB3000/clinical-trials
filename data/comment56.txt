Therapy! Talk therapy and CBT is a great starting place for undoing these kinds of loops. There are all kinds of therapeutic approaches to treat issues like this.

Different people will respond to different methods. Some people do like to be immersed in their trigger until it holds no power over them, some people learn biofeedback techniques. Some folks practice and refine grounding techniques. I see a lot of people whose primary coping mechanism is taking an immediate release anxiolytic (like xanax) or using an illicit substance... So a lot of the longterm approach is about replacing that behavioral response to a trigger with something much safer and healthier.
