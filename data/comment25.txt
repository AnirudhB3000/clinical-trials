I am not a doctor, but do have anxiety, but it gets way worse due to caffeine/coffee which causes insomnia and IBS (which I am finding caffeine/coffee to be my main trigger) and PCOS (hormone imbalance). So it’s like a huge domino effect, treating my anxiety did not fix my other problems, but treating my other problems helps with my anxiety.  It can be a chicken-egg type thing with this stuff, and I definitely had some anxiety but it never got unmanageable until I hit my mid-20’s and I ended up with these other issues.

Edit:  Allergies as well popped up in my mid 20’s, and have had slight asthma issues as well.
