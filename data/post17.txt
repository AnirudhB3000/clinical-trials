Is there any system through which someone can suggest a clinical trial? Going back as far as I can remember, I've had a lot of difficulty differentiating faces. It was only a few years back when I found out this is a real medical condition: prosopagnosia. It can be caused by damage to a certain region of the brain (the fusiform face area), but a lot of people just seem to have it with no particular explanation. I'm the latter type -- no head injuries, definitely not anywhere near that area. It is (was) frustrating, awkward, and inconvenient, leaving me with social anxiety I struggled with for years (making friends is scary when you can't even remember the faces of the people closest to you); eventually I learned to manage.

Then, a few months ago, I started taking Wellbutrin for depression. Almost immediately, I realized I could quickly and easily recognize people without thinking about it, something I can't recall ever having been able to do. Interestingly, this doesn't just apply to learning people's faces; I've been recognizing people I haven't seen since substantially before I started the medication. Nothing medical has changed other than that (haven't been in an accident, struck by lightning, bit by radioactive spider, etc.).

I do know a couple other people who have this disorder, but two people doesn't make much of a sample. Wellbutrin is cheap and fairly harmless, and if it really does work to treat prosopagnosia, it might help the social issues of a lot of people with the disorder. Is there anyone I can pass this on to who might be interested in the possibility?
