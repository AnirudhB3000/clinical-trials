Was hospice the right decision? I’m (27 f) emotionally going through the ringer here. My mom (61 f) who has been battling stage 4 breast cancer since 2015, was told 4 weeks ago her liver wasn’t responding to the chemo and the tumors were increasingly growing. They quickly changed to a new chemo in hopes that it responds well to the liver tumors- but no luck. The bilirubin numbers were high, starting at 2.1, then 4.9 a a week later, and a 11.2 the following week. I was told there is nothing else we can do. No more chemo, no radiation. Her liver is failing. I asked about clinical trials, liver transplant, and immunotherapy- all which I was told she doesn’t qualify for due to the Mets spread to her bones, lungs and brain as well. She had brain surgery a year ago to remove a tumor and was told she had leptomeningeal disease. But that improved with intrathecal injections + cyber knife radiation.  

Hospice was the only option other than taking her home regularly with a home health aide. Which was not enough support in my opinion with her current state. I chose hospice after hearing the recommendation of two oncologists (including her regular oncologist) and 3 ER doctors. I feel guilty for choosing this option. She’s at home and for the past 3 days now she’s been mostly asleep. Barely speaking. I’m so scared. Every time I give her morphine I feel immense guilt. I’m only 27, this is a a lot. Medically, what is your advice?
