Bumex with liver embolization clinical trial? Was wondering if anyone had any insight on the matter. Am meeting with the main doctor running the trial in a week or so, but any insight or advice would be appreciated. 

For background, it is my 65 yr old father who will be undergoing the liver embolization for his liver cancer. Already had a resection a couple years ago and it didn't go too well. As of now, the Dr gave him 12-24 months, but with this embolization procedure (and potential future repeats) this could hopefully be extended by years. Nothing else they can really do for him besides this embolization procedure. 

They are interested in him also taking bumex during the procedure as it apparently helps. 

Here's the info I found on the trial.

Anyone here familiar with this? Aware of any potential risks? Know of success stories or the opposite? 

Also interested in any insight on the liver embolization procedure in general. 

Thanks.
