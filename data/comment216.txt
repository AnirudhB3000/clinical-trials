Oh, so you’re taking a new, different stance on your usual prescription practices - but only for this one, heavily politicized drug, not for any other drug.

Thank you for your transparency, but I don’t agree with practitioners allowing their political beliefs to shape their medical practice. Hopefully you grow past this phase.
