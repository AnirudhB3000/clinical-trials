Question about a heart condition I'm 30, Male, 125 lbs

So, I have cancer, my doctor is considering a clinical trial and I was just looking at the exclusion criteria for the trial I believe he is considering. I will bring it up at our next appointment, but right now this is bothering me.



One of the exclusion criteria is "Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled diabetes, clinically significant pneumonitis, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements."



I have premature ventricular contractions (unmedicated, monitored by my electrophysiologist), that have been as high as 20,000 in a 24 hour period (last time I did a 24 hour holter, it was around 100 per 24 hours).



Would my PVCs potentially disqualify me from this trial?
