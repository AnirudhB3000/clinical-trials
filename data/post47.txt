Been vaccinated for a year and looking for information you decide what next step is... 34F, 135lbs, 5'4, very fit and healthy. I participated in a clinical trial for the Oxford/AZ vaccine in November of 2020. When I was eligible for the vaccine, I was unblinded from the study and learned that I had received the vaccine. 

I am not looking for medical advice, but I'm looking for information so that I can make the best possible decision for myself. I've called the clinical trial place and they have yet to receive guidance from AZ, I have tried to contact my doctor but they can only give CDC recommendations. 

My options are to get a booster or get a new vaccine all together. I am not sure how bad I would feel in both scenarios or if either one would be considered dangerous. At this point, knowing I have received the vaccine almost a year ago, I don't feel all that protected but would like to. 

What would be the benefits vs risks of the booster vs. another original dose?

Edit: sorry for the typo in the title. Should say "to decide what next step is"
