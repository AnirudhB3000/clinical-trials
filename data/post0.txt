Are clinical trials worth it? Me: 27F residing in SoCal. I’ve always dealt with depression, have been diagnosed with severe clinical depression as a kid and as an adolescent. Also diagnosed with ADD as a child, but have not been medicated since my sophomore year in high school (over 10 years ago now.) I was told from a young age I would need to take medication daily to function normally. 

My depression has advanced to new levels, causing my brain to literally break. About a year ago, I would get so overwhelmed and stressed I would shake from my brain thinking of everything and nothing at the same time. It’s made me learn to dissociate, so much to the point where nothing interests me, nothing motivates me, nothing brings me joy. I look at things but I don’t really see them. I’m here but I’m not present. I feel like I’m falling deeper and deeper into a bottomless pit of nothingness. 

I don’t have health insurance, really can’t afford it. But I’m desperate at this point. I really hate the person I’ve become, and the mindset I have. I’m so desperate I’ve thought about joining a clinical trial, but am worried that might do more harm than good. 

Though there’s so many I don’t know what would be best. Is it even worth the time to sign up for?
