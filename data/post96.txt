You think Ivermectin and HCQ help Covid? Great, I'm all ears. Please post and link me your studies showing how effective they are. Over the last several months I've seen numerous physicians jump on the conspiracy bandwagon (on numerous sites) about how these drugs are fabulous for Covid. Oh, if only we used them more so many lives would be saved...

Ok, fine. I'm all ears. By all means please link me your well crafted double blinded clinical research studies that have been published in a decent peer reviewed source. Please show me the randomized trials. Show me the research.

Surely after 2 years there have been several well done studies that show good effects. Because when I look all I can find is study after study that says "no effort", "no significant difference", "requires toxic dose for effect".  But hey, maybe I'm just stupid and don't know where to look. 

So here it is. I'm wide open. PLEASE link me a couple of well done studies showing how great these things are. Maybe I'm looking in all the wrong places. Show me what I'm missing.
