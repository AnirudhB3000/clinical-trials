Hi, I'm kind of lurking here. That is what happened to me, after the first time, it quickly became more and more frequent, like it was easier to have a panic attack trigger the more of them I had. I can only assume it became a learned behavior and was my brains go-to response to stress and fear. How does a person unlearn this?
