I spoke to my GP in May and asked to have my iron and vitamin B12 checked because I had been feeling cold, fatigued, and having pins and needles/tingling in my hands and feet. Once the results were in, she had me start taking 1250mcg of vitamin B12 and wanted a repeat blood test in 3 months. The repeat test was last week, and she called me the day after to let me know that she now wants a repeat CBC in 8 weeks because a couple of the values (WBC and neutrophils) were low. I also had a blood test done in July for a bunch of different things as my psychiatrist had referred me to a clinical trial and my WBC levels were low in that one, however neutrophils were normal (am not going to participate in the trial, don't think that's relevant though). I don't think my GP got the results of that one, and everything else tested was normal.

She didn't mention whether this was concerning or related to the previous B12 deficiency, and Google has me a little worried because I've also been having unexplained skin itching (no changes in soap/detergent/diet/environment) and night sweats (thought it was related to my meds) since sometime in the winter, and a couple of what I'm guessing are swollen lymph nodes in my groin. I would really just like some reassurance that this is likely a fluke and that I'm stitching things together that don't really belong together.

I've had 3 COVID vaccines at this point and as far as I know have not had COVID or had any illnesses/infections recently (have to test 2-3x weekly for my work).

May - WBC 5.5 (ref 4.0-11.0), neutrophils 2.5 (ref 2.0-7.5), vitamin B12 117 LO (ref 138-652)

July - WBC 3.7 LO, neutrophils 2.0
