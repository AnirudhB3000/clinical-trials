Exactly this. A huge chunk of my anxiety is directly related to my chronic pain. Even if I'm not actively in pain now, I know that I inevitably will me soon, and it definitely contributes to my anxiety. I have had small panic attacks before simply because of the amount of pain I'm in. I truly wish that there were more studies on the anxiety-pain correlation.
