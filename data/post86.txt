Does eliminating coffee and other things really help GERD? I am 35 years old, a male, 5'8 in height, 165 weight, white is my race, I do not smoke cigarettes, I do not take other medication, good fitness. (hopefully this is detailed enough not to get my post removed for a 3rd time). 

My doctor told me yesterday to eliminate about 10 different things, including coffee. When I look on the internet, I see the same list. But I came across the American College of Gastroenterolgy which said:

*An evaluation of clinical trials on the effectiveness of various lifestyle modifications finds evidence in support the some of these common lifestyle modifications, yet little or no evidence for others: “Consumption of tobacco (12 trials), chocolate (2 trials), and carbonated beverages (2 trials) and right lateral decubitus position (3 trials) were shown to lower pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), whereas consumption of alcohol (16 trials), coffee and caffeine (14 trials), spicy foods (2 trials), citrus (3 trials), and fatty foods (9 trials) had no effect. There was an increase in esophageal acid exposure times with tobacco and alcohol consumption in addition to ingestion of chocolate and fatty foods. However, tobacco and alcohol cessation (4 trials) were not shown to raise LESP, improve esophageal pH, or improve GERD symptoms. In addition, there have been no studies conducted to date that have shown clinical improvement in GERD symptoms or complications associated with cessation of coffee, caffeine, chocolate, spicy foods, citrus, carbonated beverages, fatty foods, or mint. A recent systematic review concluded that there was lack of evidence that consumption of carbonated beverages causes or provokes GERD.”*

This seems to suggest that coffee should be ok. That's one thing I'm really not liking quitting, so I'd like to know if our reddit doctors have any input here?
