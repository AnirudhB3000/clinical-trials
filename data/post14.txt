Is it safe for me (35m) to get vaccinated if I already (maybe) have been as part of a clinical trial? I signed up for the Johnson & Johnson clinical trial in mid December. I believe I was one of the last people in America to participate in the trial. When I first called they gave me an appointment, then the next day I got a call saying that it was cancelled as the study was full. Then later that day, I got a call saying that Johnson and Johnson changed their mind and wanted like 100 more people and I was one of them if I wanted.

Anyway, I had a little muscle pain in my arm where I got the shot and felt a little sick the next day (like a mild cold maybe) which leads me to believe I got the vaccine instead of the placebo. Still I know this could have been a coincidence or just in my head, so I think I should proceed as if I haven't been vaccinated. Especially since we don't know how effective that vaccine is yet.

The paperwork they gave me says I can't get a covid vaccine while I'm part of the study. But it also says that I can drop out of the study whenever I want for any reason at no penalty (besides that they won't pay me anymore, presumably).

So I'm thinking that I may just drop out of the study when I can get vaccinated for sure. Though that may be a while as I'm 35, have no health issues besides hypertension that is controlled by medication, and work from home.

I know that there is probably no publicly available data (or perhaps any at all) about how safe it would be to get different vaccine if you've received the Johnson and Johnson one. But perhaps you could tell me if it is generally safe to get vaccinated twice for the same disease. 

Thanks in advance for any responses.
