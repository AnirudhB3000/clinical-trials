Emergency Use Medical Device I'm 34 Female former smoker with a long list of physical and mental health problems- recurring kidney stones, primary Sjogren's, diabetes, high blood pressure, dysautonomia, non length-dependent small fiber neuropathy, pcos, psoriasis, diverticulosis, spinal stenosis, spinal cord impingement, 9 herniated discs, and 2 hernias. I also have cptsd, severe medical ptsd, GAD, and depression. On top of that I have a history or hospital acquired infections- mrsa and c diff. I also have a large list of medication and environmental allergies.

I have a blocked 5mm distal ureter stone right now and on top of my health risks for surgery I have had a horrible time with post op experiences for stone removal and stent placement in the past and that was before I developed many of the health conditions I currently have. The stent causes me more pain than the stone which is uncontrollable and then I have resulting infections and stroke level blood pressure along with reactive inflammation around the stent. My medical ptsd wouldn't even allow me to go in for a surgery so I'm basically looking at death if I don't have a non-surgical option. My doctor sent a referral for a Sonomotion (first non-surgical kidney stone treatment) clinical trial but I'm not eligible based on the stone's location. I desperately need emergency use or a very quick compassionate access granted due to my history and current situation. Does anyone know how often this is granted? We've talked with the doctor briefly through email but he didn't discuss any use outside of the clinical trial.
