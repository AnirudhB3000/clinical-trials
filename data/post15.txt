Is doing a malaria clinical trial worth it?  I have the opportunity to do a clinical trial for two new fda-approved malaria medications by the USARMY MEDCOM near DC. I will be dosed with the medication for 3 weeks then exposed to malaria infected mosquitoes and then go in for weekly checkups for the next 3 weeks. I will be compensated somewhere between 2600 and 3000 USD for the trial, it sounds like. I've been reading up on malaria stories though and it looks pretty bad, even with access to modern medicine in a first world country. Should I reconsider this? I don't particularly need the money, but I am a college student so it would be nice.
