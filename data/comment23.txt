I don't have panic attacks per se (though that was my original diagnosis many years ago). I've thought I've needed the emergency room a number of times for heart related concerns. One time I went for abdominal pain it turned out to be appendicitis that necessitated urgent surgery. It was the least urgent I have ever felt about going to the ER, and I was sure I would be sent home like all other times. I have since then abdominal pains far worse than the appendicitis that have turned up nothing and resolved on its own. The appendicitis pain was not that bad. I realized it more from its location, getting worse on standing, low-grade fever, and worse than usual tachycardia. WBC was 17k and CT scan showed it, though. I followed my instincts, but most of the time my instincts result in eye-rolls or a diagnosis of mental heath issues. I continue to have unexplained lack of stamina, chest discomforts, and periods of severe near-syncope. Sometimes chest pains have been bad enough have gone to ER. I have had to learn that I can't trust my body, or that science isn't advanced enough to help.

Edit: Also, there was a period of time where I regularly had a pulse in the 150s. My psychiatrist said there was no such thing as a maximum dose of Ativan if it hadn't yet achieved therapeutic effect. He had me take more and more until pulse came down. My pulse didn't come down. Went to my PCP who gave me a "baby dose" of Inderal and instantly felt better and pulse came down to normal. Was eventually diagnosed with "POTS like" symptoms by cardiologist.
