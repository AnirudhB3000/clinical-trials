Is it safe to get an iron infusion with low Vitamin D levels? 39F.

Chronically low ferritin and low-normal hemoglobin for years.  (Symptomatic: fatigue, light headed, Short of breath on mild exertion, heat intolerance, etc) Have tried multiple oral supplementation options with little if any benefit.  (Current ferritin 15, hemoglobin 120 g/l)

GP suggested one dose iron infusion (monoferric). I had read that low Vitamin D and low phosphate can lead to dangerous hypophosphatemia so I asked GP to check those levels. (He had never heard of those levels being an issue with infusion, but is a good and responsive doc and ordered those tests)

Vitamin D is 51.2nmol/L ("normal" range is 75-250). (I have taken 1000IU daily for past year)

GP said he spoke with rep for monoferric and they said there is no issue. (Their website says 3.5% of people in clinical trials developed hypophosphatemia.) A rep's job is to sell the drug as effective/safe so not sure I trust them saying it's fine.  

Any hematologists or oncologists out there with insight/experience who can tell me if I should try and get my Vitamin D level up before doing infusion or if it's not a big deal?
