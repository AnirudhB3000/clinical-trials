One of the Italian doctor posts on here the other day mention old people crumping quickly and coming in early. Then young people compensating for a while before they crash and come in, effectively creating a lack of resources for the more viable population. Could get ugly. 

At least we are a few weeks behind Italy and can hopefully get some data from them on how long it is taking people to recover vs those who arenâ€™t coming off pump alive. May help you have a better idea of how to triage.
