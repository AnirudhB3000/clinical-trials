Unfortunately in the ECMO business, we often run into “hindsight is 20-20” a lot because we don’t have time to do a thorough review of history before making a quick decision to implant during crash-burn situations.   Normally I would have minimal hesitation about putting a 60 year old “young” patient on ECMO. We also obviously don’t know what the next ECMO candidate is going to look like or when they’ll role in. Usually not a huge problem when we aren’t in a rush to free up pumps. That problem will, needless to say, be more exaggerated with stretched resources and less than optimal patients to start with.
