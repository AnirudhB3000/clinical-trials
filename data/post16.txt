Question about Clinical Trials and blood tests Back in October, I signed up for a clinical trial testing GMI-1271 and was excluded due to a low platelet count. Now, there are a multitude of reason why you could be excluded, but one that stuck out was for viral infections. This includes HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C. Do they doctors have an obligation to tell me that I have one of those or would they just tell me why I was excluded, e.g. a low blood platelet count. I was explicitly told a low blood platelet count.
