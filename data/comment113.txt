>if anyone is looking for the medical equivalent of r/eyebleach

I don’t think it’s going to be the subreddit for “uplifting anecdotes” without any papers, much less good papers. You are repeating exactly the same problem that is decried right in this thread.

Don’t promote non-medical subreddits in r/medicine.
