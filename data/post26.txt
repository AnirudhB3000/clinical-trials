I have been to 3 separate dermatologists for my issue. What's next?  I have little rashes/pimples/ingrown hairs whatever the heck they are under my boxers. I've tried everything topical and oral medication under the sun, even 6 months with Accutane which led to nothing. Who do I go to now?
Is there a college professor in a log cabin waiting to come out for one last job? Can I sign up for a clinical trial and make $?

I'm seriously at a loss. Each doctor had a different interpretation and I stuck with the treatments all the way through. Is there a final boss? Do I just say f it?

I didn’t provide a picture b/c I’m not looking for ID here. Or maybe I am if some of you are geniuses, i just want to know how to escalate this. Who is the manager and can I speak to them.
