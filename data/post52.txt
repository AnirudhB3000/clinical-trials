MLST study results, need help understanding I 32M did an overnight sleep study with a follow on MLST the next day. The results posted to my online chart. It is looking for narcolepsy or other sleep disorders. 

My medicine is 100mg amitriptyline, 40mg propranolol, and fremanezumab (migraine shot).

The sleep study results posted and only say:

“Impression: no significant sleep disorder breathing was observed. Sleep stage architecture is within normal limits. 

CPAP trial was not indicated. 

Recommendation: Multiple Latentcy Sleep Test MLST was performed the following day as ordered if clinically indicated. 

The MLST showed to be abnormal with Sleep Onset REM (SOREM) in 3 of 4 naps which is indicative of REM sleep disorder. Clinical correlation is recommended.” 

This is all it says and is signed by a M.D. 

I have sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations, extreme brain fog during the day and sometimes muscle weakness that hasn’t been explained by neurology through EMG or bloodwork and muscle biopsy. 

Is this doctor talk for narcolepsy? It doesn’t say anything about the average onset of sleep latency.
