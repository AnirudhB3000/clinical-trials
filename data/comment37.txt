When my mom was having her *second* heart attack, she'd been telling every nurse/doctor/tech she saw since entering the ER that she was having a heart attack. Every last one of those motherfuckers wrote it off as anxiety. 

They were about to discharge her, despite her protests, when another doctor came into the room to ask my dad about a problem with his email (my dad was the hospital CIO). The doctor happened to glance at one of the monitors in passing on his way out and was like, "O_O oh my God, you're having a heart attack. Don't get up, and try to relax," and rushed out into the hallway to get more people. My mom was hollering after him, "I FUCKING WELL *TOLD* YOU ASSHOLES!"
