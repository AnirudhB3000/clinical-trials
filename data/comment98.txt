They found a very small ulcer that was filled with cancer cells. So I guess we could say that it was in fact some form of tumor. But the docs described is as an ulcer, so i don't know if there's a distinction beyond that. Mentally I'm near about where I've generally always been. In general you can't be happy for others because that will run out one day. You can only be independently happy if you want to make it work long term. I go about my daily routine, some things have changed of course and there are things that can make me a little depressed at times I'm not gonna dwell on them lest they actually bring me down which will only make the situation harder. You have to consider how you body works. Our physical health is tied closely to our mental health and vis-versus. A mind that is of poor health will only lead to a body of the same.  So if I want my physical body to repair and be healthy then I can't expect it to do so unless I keep my mind healthy as well.
