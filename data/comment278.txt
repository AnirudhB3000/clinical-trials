Agreed that this does pass the smell test, but still hesitant to disseminate any data that isn't clearly sourced. For the sake of transparency, would you be willing to edit the line that says "this is the account of a front line Seattle ICU physician, this is his story:" to something that makes clear that the source is not clear and this is *purportedly* from a Seattle ICU physician? I know you're just quoting the original text with that, but it can be misleading
