Clinical trial I was thinking of participating in a clinical trial. I will be asking for their advice on possible side effects, but its phase 1, so a lot of the side effects aren't known. My main concern is a long-term issue, like cancer. Some medications are carcinogenic when taken regularly, but what are the odds of an experimental medication (where they maybe don't have the dose right) causing cancer when taken for a few days? The company I was thinking of doing it with was the same one that had the Northwick Park accident, where people had organ failure and were told they'd develop cancer in the future. How likely is the risk of developing cancer from a few doses of an experimental medication?
