Why did two doctors look at my venous ultrasound and come back with two different results? Female, 22yo,  5'5" 130lbs, non-drinker and non-smoker

I've complained of debilitating vein-related problems in my legs for the last 4 years. 

Two venous ultrasounds (2019 in TX, late 2021 in OR) came back normal. Recently a vein clinic read my 2021 "normal" ultrasound results saying that my veins looked more dilated than she would like to see. I googled a couple of the ranges in the results, and what I've read on the internet confirms what the vein clinic is saying. So I just did a new ultrasound with the vein clinic and was told I do in fact have chronic venous insufficiency. 

Why would the first two doctors who read the venous ultrasounds determine them to be normal? Is the vein clinic more knowledgable about how to interpret leg veins specifically since that is their wheelhouse? Since I'm female, do a lot of clinics interpret ranges that were originally studied on the male body (like how medical trials for new pills, or crash test dummies for cars are often tested on male bodies and not females)? Outside of the cost of the ultrasound itself, there is no financial gain the vein clinic has in diagnosing me with CVI since there is no cure anyway, and I'd be getting sclerotherapy and compression stockings regardless of the ultrasound outcome.
