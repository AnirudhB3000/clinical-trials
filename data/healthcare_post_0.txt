[Discussion] Why don't third parties provide post-patent competition in the drugs industry? Check out 9:29 - 10:12 of this video: [https://youtu.be/nuiUt6VxhQQ?t=569](https://youtu.be/nuiUt6VxhQQ?t=569)

Ok, something doesn't make sense, here. So let's assume that one of the insulin companies gets a patent for "Insulin 2000," a version of insulin that was invented, and patented, in June 2000. Sor for twenty years, they are the only ones allowed to sell "Insulin 2000." But then, in June 2020, they file a new patent for "Insulin 2020." Now, they have until June of 2040 to enjoy a legal monopoly for Insulin 2020.

But ... couldn't third parties now swoop in and start making and selling their own Insulin 2000? This guy says that the new patent isn't even necessarily and improvement over the old version, so why should the doctors (and more importantly, the patients) give a shit about it being an "old" or "obsolete" version? This isn't a model of smartphone, here! Being on the "cutting edge of trends" for its own sake should not be a priority here!

Does anyone have an explanation as to why third parties don't simply do that?
