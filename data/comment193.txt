"Top scientists" in what field? That's a pretty broad stroke... I worked in biomedical research for over a decade and the "top" scientists were never humble. It's a pretty well known thing that principle investigators can be difficult to work with and are often arrogant. It might be different in physical sciences, but not biomedical sciences.
