I realized a lot of the studies are very flawed and most have been withdrawn for lack of statistically significant data.
This one in the lancet seems to support some evidence of symptomatic improvement ( although self reported so🤷🏼‍♀️). Like I said prior.. I would like to see a well designed study to nail the coffin one way or the other and not just dismissing it our of hand.
