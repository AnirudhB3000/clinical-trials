how often are lab results wrong? hi, I'm 25F and recently had some lab work done that indicated I was near kidney failure. This was for a clinical trial (I had not started the medication yet) and was preceded by another CMP two weeks earlier that was fine. the study clinic called me and asked me to come in ASAP (that day or the next) to redraw, but the NP I saw while there said their gut feeling is that there was a mixup at the lab they ship samples out to and I got the wrong results. I know the people processing labs are human and make mistakes like anyone else, but I've always heard those things are so rare that I'm not sure what to believe. 

I've had some flank and upper abdominal pain every day for a week or two now, and on and off for like a year before that, but nothing terrible and I think I might be reading too far into it in light of the situation. In terms of objective values, all bloodwork I've had previously has been pretty much normal. I just want to know if I should be concerned or just trust that it's probably not really my results for the time being?

Again, 25F, around 190lbs, 5'8, only medications before this were jornay pm 40mg (methylphenidate) and trazadone 100mg occasionally for sleep.
