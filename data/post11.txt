Mom[57F] diagnosed with Incidental Gallbladder Cancer Stage 3 T2N1. Should she participate in clinical trial? What questions do I ask? Mom[57F] African-American diagnosed with incidental gallbladder cancer Stage 3 T2N1. 5’5” 165lbs. I’ll try to be as detailed as possible about this. Found when being treated for gallstones. She has no major prior health issues. She received a Cholecystectomy about a month ago in which they removed her gallbladder and the nearest lymph node. Since then her blood tests have come back normal multiple times, she has received 2 MRIs and a CT scan in the past 3 months, the most recent being a few days ago, none showing spread to other organs so far. She has the option to participate in a neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in which she’ll receive 3 months of chemo on the front end, have an extended cholecystectomy to have 6 lymph nodes and a small portion of her liver removed. Followed by 3 more months of chemotherapy, as opposed to an extended cholecystectomy followed by 6 months of chemotherapy. Her doctor’s think she could be a good candidate for the trial, and I trust the care she’s receiving but I want to be able to advocate for her too. Should I include the study as well? Additionally if any GI doctors (or any experienced physicians honestly) have any information of the possible outcome, that would be helpful.
