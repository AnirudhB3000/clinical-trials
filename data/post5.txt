Covid 19 clinical trial Hey guys I am a 24 year old male, very healthy no underlying health conditions and I weigh 156 lbs at 5 foot 8. next Thursday I start my clinical trial for covid 19. I signed up (thinking jt was unpaid), because I wanted to be part of the research team to help the world come up with a vaccine. I get injected on Thursday and I know I can die if all goes bad. Has anybody had a clinical trial done in the past? And how did jt go? What was your experience ? Thanks in advance.
