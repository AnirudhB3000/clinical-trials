They really should know better. It's shocking to me how willfully ignorant some nurses are. 

That being said, there is one LPN RCM at my SNF who is just like me. She'd text me mid-shift and say stuff like, "Get in here and help me debate the DON about evolution." Or, "Tatyana and Wendee are talking about how they think kids get too many vaccines these days. Kill me now!"

And don't get me started on that "People die in threes" bullshit.
