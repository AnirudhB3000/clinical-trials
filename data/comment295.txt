We don't normally put coughing or sneezing patients on precautions.  If they suspect flu, rapid tests that aren't very reliable are usually performed in the ED.  On the basis of the results, if the docs feel it's likely flu anyway, they leave the droplet precautions in place till PCR results are obtained.  

In the COVID situation, things are different, namely, we're running out of PPE for the entire hospital.  Evergreen stated yesterday, for example, that they only have 4d of gloves left, and are waiting on a federal emergency supply to buy them a little more time.  China is our supplier for almost all of these things, and they were not being produced for several months.  Additionally, China needs to restock itself before they begin distributing supplies here.  It's a terrible situation.
