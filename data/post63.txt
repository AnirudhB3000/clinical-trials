COVID Vaccine Effectiveness In the past months, we've heard a lot about vaccines in the news. Every time COVID vaccines are brought up regarding their clinical trial effectiveness data, we hear that it was found to be effective across age, sex, ethnicity, etc. 

Age makes sense--our immune system weaken with age. I've heard that women tend to have more robust immune responses, okay. 

But ethnicity? Is there any known vaccine or medicine that works well with White people but not Black or Asian people or vice versa or whatever? If so, why would that be?
