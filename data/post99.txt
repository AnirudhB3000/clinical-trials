Any MDs working in pharamcueticals? How do you set your salary? I am a physician considering leaving clinical practice to work with a small (\~10 employees) pharma company that has quite a few patents and is in the process of clinical trials.  They are looking for me to run their clinical trials in certain populations as well as help with the NDA.  I would start part time and ramp up to full time.

I have no idea what is a reasonable salary for this type of work.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.
