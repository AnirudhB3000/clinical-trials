The lab abnormalities is specifically why I posted it.  Testing is still not being broadly performed, and for those of us rendering care for these patients, we need some sort of marker to better protect ourselves.  Further, we have ready ability to test for flu, RSV, etc., and can rule those out rapidly as causes.  Diagnosis by subtraction is what we're working with.

I am curious though, why no NIPPV?  We're *definitely* using it, and I haven't heard any argument as why not to?  A lot of our patients, even before COVID, need it continuously to stay alive.
