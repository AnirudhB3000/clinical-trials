I really think it just depends on the doctor. My GP is great, I really like him. He's patient and thorough. For a few months I was dealing with panic attacks, but they were so sudden and unexpected that we didn't know if anxiety was causing the attack or if some organic problem was causing the attack and the accompanying anxiety. From day 1, he told me he thinks it's just anxiety, but he said if it is just anxiety, ruling anything else out will give me the peace of mind I need to help mitigate the anxiety, so that at least I'll know nothing bad is actually happening. Knowing nothing was likely to be physically wrong, he still performed every test available to rule out a hormonal problem or vitamin/mineral deficiency, and even referred me to a cardiologist to have a cardiac workup to rule out any heart problems. Everything came back great, and his original suspicion of anxiety was confirmed. And not only was he right about the anxiety, but he was also right about the peace of mind having all those tests done gave me. It's now so much easier to manage my anxiety and try to unlearn the panic response since I know nothing is actually physically wrong, and I'm not dying. 

But yeah, he's been great. He listened to my concerns, wanted to make sure I was healthy, and wanted to alleviate my fears and concerns. In my opinion that is a great doctor, as he really did help me even though he knew nothing was wrong. I know it can be a pain to get some doctors to look into the possibility of health problems when they think it's just anxiety, but a good doctor will keep their minds open to the possibility of either or both.
