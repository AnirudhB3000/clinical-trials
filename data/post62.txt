Red line from where I had blood work taken from I recently had some blood taken as I’m taken part in a clinical trial; this trial is worth mentioning involves nothing to do with any new drugs or treatments and is instead a dietary clinical trial to put it simple.

In terms of myself, I’m an 18 year old male from England, 5’9”, 70kg near enough, occasional weekend drinking, couple of units or so, no recreational drugs etc, only take codeine occasionally because of flare ups I sometimes get from my gall bladder removal at the start of 2019.

As for my problem, as I said I had blood taken for this trial, and I’ve noticed a red line coming from the site where the blood was drawn through about 3cm of my arm, running in a straight line almost parallel to my vein. I should also point out that after the blood was taken, I seemed to have bled a lot more into the plaster and slightly around the site. I know this is a lot more because I donate blood when I can and I’ve had several bouts of blood work done previously. The line is dark enough that I can see it, but faint enough that my camera can’t pick it up.

Any cause for concern?
