Peanut oral food challenge for 5 y/o Good whatever part of the day it is for you. My five year old son, about 3ft, 43 lbs, no eczema, no asthma, if it’s relevant, has Dennie-Morgan folds, was diagnosed as peanut, walnut, pecan allergic at 10 months old and recently tested negative for all ARA peanut proteins in blood test and also negative on skin test. When I gave him peanut butter for about the fifth or sixth time I noticed him breaking out into circumoral hives, and his eyes started getting very watery and red, so I automatically assumed peanut allergy and took him straight to the urgent care. They sent us to an allergist and a skin test confirmed peanut allergy.  As the last few years passed, we’ve noticed the blood test and skin tests getting less and less reactive, and this latest round were completely negative, so the allergist recommended an oral food challenge, to see if he the allergy has resolved. 

When he was about 18 months old he was in a clinical trial for the peanut patch, but when he was fed the peanut proteins the only reaction was one tiny hive on his lip and so they judged him not allergic enough to go ahead with the trial. It was about the equivalent of 1.5 µg of peanut protein.

Our big day is tomorrow at University of Michigan. Is there any allergist here who can tell me what to expect? What do they do? How do they feed him the peanuts? I know that if he has a reaction that all the medication necessary to reverse it will be right there. I know that there is more than likely an equal chance of him passing the challenge and being declared resolved of the allergy, and I know that there is also a chance that he will not pass the challenge and then be able to go through oral immuno therapy. Any insight or words of encouragement are welcome. Thank you so much for your time
