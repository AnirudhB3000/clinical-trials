High Bilirubin for the Past Two Years For the last two years I've had high bilirubin. I know this because I've signed up for some clinical trials that have turned me down, and my job does yearly medical testing. I barely drink(about 3 times a year), I don't do drugs(or smoke), I also drink plenty of water and work out. I've limited my sugar intake for working out as well. I'm really confused as most of the time my bilirubin comes back as a .3 (should be around .2 if I remember correctly). I've looked it up and there aren't many medicines to reduce bilirubin and even if there were, it still wouldn't help my problem. Should I go to my doctor's or will they just tell me to do everything I've been doing?
