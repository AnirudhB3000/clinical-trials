Try visiting hospitals and clinics in the South. You find more churchgoing doctors than not. Every now and then you may catch a doctor in a room praying with a patient and family, which I find inappropriate on multiple levels. 
We even have a NEUROLOGIST at my hospital that discourages vaccinations because his son is autistic and he believes that vaccines are the root cause.

Don’t spread misinformation about groups of people. It typically is individual and not career or education based. It’s kind of absurd and ignorant in itself to suggest otherwise.

I get that you can have faith/be religious and also believe in evolution, however that’s a whole other issue.  It could be argued that religion is a total crock of shit altogether with all its mythology and fantastical notions, but that’s an opinion and not a fact? Right?
