Could you help me understand Spirometry results? F29 225 lbs 5'5 no smoking  
I took a spirometry test today as part of a clinical trial (healthy participant) and the doctor said I should see a pulmonologist. The first available appointment is in 3 months so I'd love some insight into the results before that. I frequently am out of breath during mild cardio exercise and have never been diagnosed with asthma. thanks for any insight you can share
