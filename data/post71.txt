64 yr old M diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. What else should I advocate his doctors rule out? Long story, my FIL has been carrying for his elderly mother slowly dying of cancer that lives three hours away. His wife is also in the final clinical trials for her terminal cancer. He is under a LOT of stress, retired last year and had to drive 14 hours every week to take his dying wife to treatments. He lost an incredible amount of weight, he says due to eating challenges related to severe GERD, in the last year. He also had a surgery in the last six month to remove calcium from his pituitary gland (I think? It was challenged to get the details) and his calcium levels dropped basic to normal quickly. However, he passed the three word test in the morning from one doctor but failed it a few hours later from a different doctor. I’m wanted to help advocate for the best care and as early onset Alzheimer’s is rare ish (is this even considered early now?) I’m not sure what the next steps would be. TIA!!!
