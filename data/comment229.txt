I’m in the same boat. I’m a PGY-2, in my mid-30s, with a husband and kids. I’m not willing to risk my life or my family’s lives with this and have begun thinking about where to draw the line. The information finally coming out about the severity and effects of this virus frankly scares me, and I know we have a PPE shortage at my hospital (it appears that much was stolen). I may just be willing to risk giving up my career in return for greater safety.
