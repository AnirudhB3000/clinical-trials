Can it wait 2 months until well child visit - possible UTI/kidney issues but completely asymptomatic My daughter, 16 (f) 5’10” 125 lbs is in a clinical trial for PXT 3003 (combo of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol for treatment for CMT 1A). She’s also on 30 mg Adderall for ADHD. Otherwise in excellent health. 

As part of the clinical trial they do labs, ua, and evaluation once a quarter. She’s had 2 quarterly follow ups so far, and in both cases her ua came back with bacteria present indicating possible UTI, most recently, it also showed high levels of CA oxalate crystals and I was told this may be a risk factor for kidney stones. They send copies of all labs to her pediatrician. After the first alert, I spoke with my daughter, who confirmed she has no symptoms of uti at all, and spoke with her pediatrician. We agreed since she’s asymptomatic it wasn’t worth treating (why take abx if you don’t need them, right?).  This time, I asked my daughter again about symptoms and she confirmed she feels completely fine.  I did suggest she needs to drink more water during the day. She also avoids using the bathroom at school so she doesn’t pee at all between 7am and 2:30pm. I’m wondering if withholding is somehow contributing to any possible issues? Anyway, her well child check will be in 2 months. Do I need to call pediatrician again and possibly have her seen sooner or can we wait until her next visit? If she was symptomatic I would take her in immediately, but these are incidental findings only because of the study protocols. 

Thoughts?
