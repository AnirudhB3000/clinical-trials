I've heard SVT is really rough. That's what I was thought to have for a short time, but it was ruled out by a monitor I wore for a month straight. I've heard accounts of SVT causing people to pass out, and causing some damage to the heart in the long-run. I hope you have that under control now, I know that must be awful.
