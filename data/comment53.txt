Absolutely! I know how hard it is to find and gather information about POTS. It's a little studied syndrome, mostly because people don't die from it. And most doctors don't have a clue either. Every time I see a new doctor I have to explain it to them myself! Another medication I just thought of that I haven't  tried personally is Midodrine. I know it works for a lot of people with POTS. Hope your sister gets back to enjoying life to the fullest soon!
