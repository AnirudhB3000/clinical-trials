Providing a false sense of security is a great way to put it.

A common refrain among the HCQ/IVM crowd is that the effectiveness of HCQ/IVM is being censored by Big Pharma. So instead of getting vaccinated (which is the obvious answer to reducing your risk of dying from COVID-19) they think they're going to outsmart everyone by taking HCQ/IVM instead. All the way to meeting the intensivist.
