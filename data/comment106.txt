Ivermectin data is far from convincing and I don’t think any of the big RCT’s going on will show any benefit.

However, I find it hilarious that our policy in the states seems to ignore every piece of data and insists on using remdesevir, yet we don’t blink twice.

Remdesevir has done nothing but increase my patients length of stay and give them a nice LFT bump.
