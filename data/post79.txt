Not a medical issue, but a curious inquiry— How often have you seen (medical personnel) panic attacks actually turn out to be non-anxiety related? Hey all, I’m currently 6 months free of a panic attack. It was a very tremendously scary moment in my life, but I’m growing and continuing to push through and make the most out of it. Throughout my own personal research on panic disorders (through viewing public academic clinical trials, case studies, etc.), it got me thinking...

At first, when my panic attacks started, I always thought that there was something seriously wrong with me and I was going to die (If you go through my post history, you can see I’ve posted on this sub before and it’s quite sad to look back on how messed up my head was at the time.) because of heart palpitations, elevated blood pressure, long episodes of sinus tachycardia, chest pain, all those horrible feelings. The internet would say stroke, heart attacks, cancer, all the things that someone my age is very, very, very unlikely to have. 

There’s of course immediate tests to rule out things like heart attacks, strokes, and so on, but how often have any of you (EMTs, Nurses, Doctors, Surgeons, anyone involved in the medical field) had a patient present with classic panic attack symptoms, but it turned out to be something else? Such as a chronic illness? I’m really curious, and I’d love to hear your outlook on how the medical community goes about adequately assessing people diagnosed with generalized panic disorder. I plan on attending medical school (fingers crossed it happens) and this is something that I would love to put time and effort into. Thank you guys, have a great one.
