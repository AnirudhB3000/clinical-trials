Prior to the symptoms I described there was absolutely zero indication something was wrong. One of the questions I've asked just about every doctors I've come across has been: "when did the cancer start?". And their answer is always the same. "We'll never know". It could have been there for years, laying dormant and causing no symptoms. Or it sprang up just recently and my initial symptoms were reflective of that. Its impossible to say. But ya. Prior to all this I was strong and healthy with a history to match.
