God bless ya for that lol. Anytime I go to my PCP he nearly always tries to push it off as anxiety related ğŸ˜• Then one time I went to urgent care and they found out I had a huge ovarian tumor that had likely been growing for years, after I was told my excruciating pain that would drop me to my knees and make me vomit was likely an anxiety symptom and to just take naproxen ğŸ™ƒ
