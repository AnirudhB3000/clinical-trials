I am not sure, I saw it both here and in a medical group I frequent; I also vetted some of the lab data against the  NEJM study and a couple of others that I've read.  Most of what's stated here appears to be a succinct retelling of what's already known, which gave me confidence in posting it.  If this person isn't at Evergreen, but the data are still accurate, I'm ok with the author not being from the cited location.  FWIW, the data are in line with the patients we've seen, though admittedly, that hasn't been many yet, and further, the CDC refused testing of the first three presumptives.
