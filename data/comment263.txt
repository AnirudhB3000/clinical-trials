I live in Seattle, and while there are definitely irresponsible people out there, a huge chunk of our population is just deciding to stay home and play video games. All K-12 schools are closed. Colleges/Unis have all online classes except for certain classes that must be done in person, like labs and clinicals. The King County Library System is closed indefinitely. Sports teams are cancelling weeks of their seasons. Retail establishments and restaurants are laying people off due to lack of customers. And while this isn't Seattle, the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park have both closed.

There are a lot of jackasses out there, but I'm actually impressed by how seriously we're taking it.
