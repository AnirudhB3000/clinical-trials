Nestrone and Testosterone used as male contraceptive. Is it possible its leading towards mood swings? I've been taking part in a clinical trial of a male contraceptive that comes in a daily gel form. It is a combination of a progestin, Nestrone, and a testosterone replacement, since the Nestrone reduces the production of testosterone in the body. 

Since March I've been having some pretty brutal mood swings, usually in the negative. I feel very moody, or upset, thay comes in goes in 1 week waves. I've been dealing with some mild stress from work, but nothing out of the usual.

I'm wondering if my contraceptive could be responsible for my mood swings, and if so if they will subside at some point, or if they will persist. 

Thank you!
