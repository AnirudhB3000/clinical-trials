Palliative radiotherapy sorry in advance for the novel 
Hello, I’m (36F) just wanting some info and thoughts and probably just a vent. My mum 62F, height 170cm, weight 49kg (previously 62kg when well) has terminal stage 4 oesophageal cancer, and has been battling for 3+ years. She went through an intense 2 years of chemotherapy and then when that stopped working she was placed on an immunotherapy clinical trial. She was on this for a year and just recently that had also stopped working. The doctors are now putting her on palliative radiotherapy, they wanted her to do a 10 day course. She is on day 4 and experiencing terrible pain, I guess I am just wondering what is the benefit/purpose of this? They said it will help with pain but it is actually causing her pain. 

For note, she is constantly in lots of pain and feels very sick for most of the day, everyday. When she was first diagnosed she was fitted with a feeding tube, but as there was so much cancer in the stomach it had to go into the bowel. She had many painful complications with this and it was removed about a year in. All she is able to ingest now is a coffee and 3 hospital grade protein drinks. 
During chemo her back broke twice, and was in extreme agony. Since being off chemo she seems a little stronger (at least her bones do) she can hardly walk around though and needs a walker. 

I honestly think they are just giving her options for the sake of it at this point. Her body just seems so frail and abused. I would be content with her just living/surviving for the remaining time we have but my dad keeps almost pressuring her to do more. My mum is obviously distressed as wants to do everything she can, but I can see how much pain she is in, she’s exhausted. 

I guess I am just looking for any advice, is it worth doing the full 10 days. Will it ease some pain? Or are the clasping at straws? 
Has anyone gone through this, would like to hear your stories if you want to share.
