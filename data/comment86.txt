A(lpha)-pinene is one of the types of CBD that some strains of medicinal marijuana are high in. A-pinene is an anti-inflammatory. (edited to add - like it sounds, it often gives a piney smell or flavor to smokables/vapables)

I find MMJ to be a strong pain reliever, however I would not want to accidentally state "I find **THC** to be a strong pain reliever" like I had just posted by accident, because "THC" is not actually interchangeable with "MMJ". Perhaps the poster you are replying to didnt mean to say "THC" but actually just meant 'medical marijuana/MMJ". I say this because MMJ often has **NO** THC content at all, and the medicinal value is NOT in the THC (which gets you high) but rather in the CBDs (which have medicinal value).

Alternatively, opiate painkillers just make me very very dizzy and I hate them. I can still feel pain on morphine (post major surgery pain) or back when I was given stadol years ago in the hospital during a difficult childbirth during which there was no time for an epidural, or even now with vicodin for a bruised tailbone that I recently sustained, or anything in between, I just don't CARE that I'm in pain anymore with those - instead I get upset that I'm dizzy and it makes me nauseous, and it makes my head feel both very heavy and very light at the same time. 

In contrast, with MMJ the pain actually stops. For me. YMMV. IANAD. best wishes to all. ETA - I agree with the the poster who says a lot has to do with delivery method. I hate edibles (unpredictable dosing, too strong most of the time, requires chewing and swallowing food that I may or may not even want which can be an issue for me in and of itself, etc) and find pills get metabolized strangely/not as expected by otherwise experienced persons in regards to their MMJ/THC intake (haven't tried the Marinol pills or spray myself - not even sure if the spray is available outside Canada, where I believe they do have it if my old info from MS forums is still correct). I'm an old-school style medicinal user as a result.
