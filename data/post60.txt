Nicotine/vape to ease ADHD I'm a 26m y/o with ADHD. I'm a no smoker but I used to smoke some 10 years ago when I was a teenager. I went to a concert two weeks ago and bought a vape. The instant feeling of relief was overwhelming. Ever since, I've been looking for the best way of getting to ingest some nicotine for it's nootropic and soothing issues. There are some clinical trials (https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00573248) that suggest nicotine might be beneficial for ADHD. And so I went deeper and found out that the main irritants in vapes are the fragrance/taste chemicals. What about products that skip the fragrance and only use Propylene Glycol (PG), Vegetable Glycerin (VG), and pharmaceutical grade Nicotine? Is there any way this could be harmful? I think I'd rather get addicted to this than ADD drugs laced with methamphetamine. But I am no doctor (obviously), that's why I'd like to see what people who know their stuff would say. Thank you.
