What a fantastic response. I can’t thank you enough, especially as you made an account to answer this so I really appreciate the effort. I will show this to my sister, and my parents. It really does put a huge strain on her, but when I see her eat sugar laden foods, I can’t help but think that can’t be doing her good - especially as her OT recommends low-carb. Many thanks again.
