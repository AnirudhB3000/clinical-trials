Potential Pharmaceutical Solutions for Cirrhosis? My father \[65M\] was diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis C about a couple years ago, which had already caused significant levels of cirrhotic scarring in his liver before the virus was expunged from his body. He is currently sitting at compensated stage 4 cirrhosis, and it is no longer progressing due to the absence of the virus.

The general recommendation from gastroenterologists that have seen him is that a partial or full liver transplant would be ideal to address the cirrhotic scarring, but the situation is currently not urgent enough to necessitate a transplant due to its compensatory nature (he is very healthy, fit, and active despite the scarring, and he does not drink alcohol or partake in any other substances which would be dangerous to his liver, although he will occasionally have issues with ammonia build-up causing mental confusion if he hasn't had a bowel movement in quite some time). We also have reservations about the idea of performing such major surgery on a 65-year-old, and are concerned over whether or not the physical stresses of the transplant would end up shortening his lifespan in the long term rather than extending it.

I wanted to inquire if any folks here in the medical profession were aware of any ongoing or pending clinical trials involving a proposed non-invasive / pharmaceutical solution for cirrhotic scarring caused by chronic Hepatitis C. Ideally, some kind of chemical or substance that could be delivered orally, by suppository, or even intravenously or directly into the liver by needle that would stimulate a breakdown of the cirrhotic scarring and allow room for the liver to heal itself over an extended period of time, assuming proper diet and exercise to keep a healthy, active lifestyle.
