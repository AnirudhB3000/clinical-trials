Ya, I agree. Having a doctor can be an invaluable resource. I can only wonder how it might have changed things had I had better access. Regarding the prognosis: On paper its generally what you might think. My cancer has infiltrated my lungs/sprine/stomach/upper intestines to varying degrees, so things can go south fast. But it was a fast growing cancer that never formed any kind of tumor or mass. Scans could only ever pick of the barest of glimpses. What docs think (potentially) is that the chemo might actually be more effective on my stuff, because, while fast growing, it also means that none of the cancer is overly strong in its own right. The chemo might be able to knock it back and allow my body to catch up naturally. So my goal has been to reorganize my diet into one of those homeopathic ones to see if we cant force it into remission. Its what my mother did. She had stage 4 breast cancer, though hers presented with a large tumor. They cut it out along with some lymph nodes. Chemo/radiation for 6 months combined with a healthy diet and shes been clean for 15 years. So theres a lot up in the air right now. Got to be prepared for the worst, but we're pushing back hard and seeing what happens.
