Link to the Pinetree trial that the other commenter mentioned: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116846 

It does seem to have reduced the rate of hospitalization in the trial when given as outpatient. I agree that we’re probably wasting resources on the inpatient side, but maybe because they’re too far along by the time they’re admitted?
