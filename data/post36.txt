Is my son's psycologist trying to scam me? I am looking for a second opinion 5 years old, male. doesn't take any medications. No other medical problems. 

Full disclosure. I am a physician (EM/IM) and my son is 5 yo. We have been evaluating for language delays, poor social skills, and extreme difficulty with attention. A year ago he got evaluated and they said he could have ASD but would need to evaluate again when older to rule out ADHD.  
  
Honestly, he does fit the picture of ADHD a lot better than he does ASD. So comes to this year where he is 5, almost 6 and getting his reevaluation. He is clearly ADHD with a bit of language processing disorder. I agree 100% with the assessment. But when talking about the "What's next" plan, the psychologist seemed to be pushing something called Neurofeedback. She says they connect kids to EEGs and play random videos that stimulate parts of their brain. I know I am not keeping up with the latest and greatest in psychiatry, but this just sounded like a way for clinics to bill "procedures" for kids watching videos twice a week. I am happy to take the time to do this, but honestly a part of me says his going to music class or playing a sport would help him build skills for focus more than watching some video.  
  
So... I've been trying to go into clinical trials to determine if this is a scam. For every article I found that supported it ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445867/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29445867/) ) with HUGE conflict of interest (yikes)... I could find two articles that find no sufficient evidence ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464474/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30464474/) , [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27238063/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27238063/) )  
  
I see some articles saying NF has improvement when added with medication when compared to meds alone, but I don't see any randomized control trials that control for NF (like a sham NF where they go in and look at nonsense instead). I'm going in as with an IM brain and maybe there is something I am missing here. So I am coming to this community looking for other doctors to tell me is this a scam or not? Thank you.
