I live in California and there’s a lot of jackasses out here. In fact, my own housemate (also a healthcare professional) decided that now is a good time to start taking public transportations so he can go have fun for the weekend and take a vacation in Europe next month because “I heard it’s no worse than the flu” and “it won’t affect me anyways.” And one of my clerks is debating going to Japan in May. And my sister’s coworker wanted to go to Italy because airline prices are low. I’m disgusted.
