PLEASE TELL ME WHICH TREATMENT TO TAKE 25F, 5'4", 135lbs, caucasian, TRD/MDD/BED for 4+ years, mild/controlled asthma, no current meds for 2 months, don't drink/smoke/use recreational drugs

After years of various types of therapy and attempts at various drugs (SSRI, SNRI, Wellbutrin, Vyvanse), I'm OVER it.  Not suicidal, but sick of living in abject misery, and I'm literally out of energy for more (useless for me) therapy.  My next step choices are TMS, ketamine, or psilocybin.  I qualify for a variety of clinical trials, but am also just willing to pay anything for relief at this point.  WHAT WOULD YOU DO?!  ðŸ¤•

I so greatly appreciate your input - THANK YOU!!!!! ðŸ©µ

(P.S.  I have been offered tricyclics or SSRI+mood stabilizer/anti-psychotic, but I haven't tried them.  I am pretty disinterested in more of these types of pharmaceuticals, although I am always interested in learning from others.)
