No one should reasonably have any issues with a study being done to assess efficacy. Ivermectin is, after all, fairly cheap and with very low risk of adverse effects. 

That being said, the previous studies already performed seem to show really no difference from placebo 🤷🏻‍♀️   I would love it if a study came out showing it worked, but I just don’t think it will ever be the case.
