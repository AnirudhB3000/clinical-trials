This response is well written, reasonable, and convincing.  Thank you for taking the time to write it.  I'd like to push back on part of it to better understand your position (not to start a silly internet fight).

You said:
"The leap from a drugâ€™s effect in a Petri dish to its use in humans is enormous and inappropriate. Quality, well-designed human studies are necessary, but unfortunately, none seem to have been completed yet."

I agree with you now, but I think a reasonable person could disagree early in the pandemic when there were no good studies and a lot of folks were dying.  The docs pushing the untested drugs weren't talking about novel molecules that had never been ingested by humans. They were using well established human medicines with reasonable side effect profiles off label based on inference.  How do you think docs should strike a balance between the two poles of "sit on my hands until there's an RCT" and "wild ass cowboy shit?"  Again, I'm not trying to pick a fight.  I truly want to better understand this perspective.  I hope you have a good day.
