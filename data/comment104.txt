This is basically on par with doctors who are also selling multi-level marketing healthcare products. Vast majority of these have dubious scientific evidence for their supposed benefits, yet doctors who want money would sell them, because a doctor's authority is believed. My local GP was a proponent of one of the biggest multilevel marketed healthcare products, which had plenty of scandals behind it. To me, I think peddling dubious products have always been in the medical community, but it was never as obvious as it is now, because vast majority did not notice it, unless you really cared. But now, everyone starts caring, because pandemic is so in your face.

edit: GP is General Practitioner in Australian parlance, or a family doctor in most places of the world.
