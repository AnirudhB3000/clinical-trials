I am not the author of this piece, I found it and it happened to answer a lot of the clinical questions I had, and thought it would be useful to all who work with such patients, so I'm hoping it gets forwarded to those who could use it.  For reference, this was written by a critical care doctor in the hospital at the nation's epicenter curerntly: Evergreen in WA outside of Seattle.  My own experience has been limited, though it's exploding now.
