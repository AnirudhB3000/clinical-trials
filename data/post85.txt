JnJ After Novavax? JnJ after Novavax?

Hey all, 

I’m in the clinical trial for the Novavax vaccine. I’ve been full vaccinated since January. Unfortunately, Novavax is still on the cusp of EMA approval and my family is traveling to France for the holidays. The US is not a green country, meaning unvaccinated travelers must have a compelling reason to go. 

Anyway, I was going to get Moderna but found out that it was recommended to take the second Moderna dose 8 weeks after the first if you’ve gotten the Novavax. 

This means I can’t get the Moderna either and am left with JnJ. Should I expect anything? Would this just be like a booster and I should expect fevers/immune response? I’m frustrated and disheartened that my vaccine isn’t approved and I have to get vaccinated again to travel. 

Thank you!
