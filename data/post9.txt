I was administered an unapproved vaccine while pregnant I am 33F, 36+3 weeks pregnant. I was happy to see the Abrysvo RSV vaccine is now approved for pregnant women up to 36 weeks. I got a prescription from my doctor and brought it into a pharmacy. I verbally confirmed with the pharm tech I would be receiving Abrysvo. She said yes. After the pharmacist administered the shot to me, I looked on his desk and saw the box said Abrexvy. 

Now, Abrexvy has not been approved in pregnant women. The current formulation (an adjuvanted version) was not ever tested in pregnant women. They had a clinical trial of an unadjuvanted version that was ended early due to possible increased risk of preterm birth. 

Anyway. I don’t know what to do. If their trial was for the unadjuvanted version, it’s possible I’m the only pregnant woman ever to receive the adjuvanted Abrexvy RSV vaccine. How concerned should I be??? (I have already messaged my OB but I’d appreciate any and all input).
