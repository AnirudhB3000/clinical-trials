Should I get 3rd opinion at MD Anderson? I’m 39/f 5’6” 120. Zoladex, exemestane, asthma medications. 

Breast cancer at age 36 (DCIS with microinvasion) bilateral mastectomies, no hormone therapy (per guidance from Dana Farber, since I was trying to get pregnant and expected benefit was very small)

Chest wall recurrence at age 38 (two 5mm tumors) treated with surgery, 6 weeks radiation, now ovarian suppression + AI. Oncotype not done with initial diagnosis, but 19 with recurrence. Small tumors and no node involvement both times. No chemo.

I’m located in the South and got second opinions after both my initial diagnosis and recurrence at Dana Farber. 

The DF doctor I saw after my initial diagnosis disagreed with my local doctor, who wanted me on Tamoxifen. 

However, the DF doctor I saw after my recurrence agreed with my local Dr.‘s treatment plan for this recurrence. 

Locally, my doctor says there are no clinical trials for me because I don’t fit the clinical definition of high risk (e.g, tumor size, lymph node involvement) and that we’re being aggressive with the hormone therapy, which is what the current research recommends. 

All this to ask, should I travel to MD Anderson to get another opinion about clinical trials or really anything to reduce my risk? I have a young daughter so I’m also thinking about furthering research for her. 

Or are they likely to agree with DF and my local doctor?
