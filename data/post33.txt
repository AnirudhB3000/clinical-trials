Going to participate in a clinical trial in Portugal.Is there any real danger? What's the worst that can happen? Just wondering, I know that right now there's a whole lot of controversy over what's happening in India, but is there any real danger in first-world countries? Is there always an element of risk?
Also, when the doctors tell me it's "this medicine" or whatever, should I trust them? Considering the placebo effect, wouldn't they just lie to me?
