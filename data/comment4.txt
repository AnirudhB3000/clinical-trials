That was before :) But I was a pretty severe case and had lots of other connected complications too that required surgery last year, so I hope I didn't scare you!

But good to hear that you are better than I was! If it's that light it shouldn't really be a problem and I guess you don't need to start drastically cutting your diet. Just keep an eye out on what you had for dinner if it's bothering you again :)
I'm no doctor though obviously, so your doctor can advise you better than this random internet stranger that has some patient experience :p
