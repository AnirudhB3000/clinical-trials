Vaccine clinical trial issue 34F, 135lbs, 5'4, healthy and active. I live in the US and had signed up for a Covid vaccine clinical trial. I received two shots. One on November 2020 and one in December 2020. This was for the AstraZeneca vaccine. As a teacher, I was eligible for an approved vaccine in March 2021 and therefore, unblinded from my clinical trial in which I found out that I DID receive the AZ vaccine back in the fall. I've been vaccinated for 8-9 months and I know there are no specific boosters available right now, but I am an educator heading back into a full classroom of ten year olds and I don't feel all that protected. I'm wondering if I should wait for boosters to come out or if I should just get the first shot of a moderna or Pfizer vaccine? I just hate the idea of wasting a second shot. 

My PCP is out on vacation this week and the nurses only gave me the CDC recommendations, not understanding that the situation is fairly unique. Thanks for any help!
