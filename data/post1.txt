Clinical Trial Safety Hi! I was wondering how safe it is to partake in clinical trials? Are there a lot of fatalities/health problems caused by clinical trials, or are they pretty “safe” in this day and age?

(Considering the gene-editing approach for HSV trials)

Can anyone who has participated in a clinical trials share their experience?
