How do I get a second opinion of the risk/benefit of a clinical trial? Wife is a 40 yo female newly diagnosed with stage IIIc ovarian cancer.  Initial cytoreduction was performed, 'maximal effort' but suboptimal results.  Several large diseased lymph nodes were not resectable.

She is considering participation in a [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03038100) but we don't really know how to adequately assess the risk/benefit of the decision.  Of immediate concern is the fact that trial paperwork could push the chemo start date back a week.  

Is this something we can just call another doc to talk through?  The drug has been approved for use with other cancers, so it's not a complete unknown.  She's trending towards participating.

Thanks
