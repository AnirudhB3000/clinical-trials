I'm looking to participate in a clinical trial to test a compound inhibiting the DGAT1 protein. I'm pretty convinced that I want to do it, does anyone want to convince me otherwise? I'm M20, healthy, pretty thin, eating good but a lot. Dosing will be on 14 consecutive days.  

Hindering DGAT1 will result in a stopped production of triglycerides, which are the main Bad fatty acid responsible for NAFLD or even NASH, as far as I understand. The compound is called GSK3008356. Main side effects are diarrhoea which seemed to be happening with similar medications effecting the same protein DGAT1 as well. Also a slight chance of hairless and even slighter chance of testicular shrinkage (yikes). 

Im currently in Australia by the way. The study is ethically approved. 

BUT I haven't told my parents yet and my girlfriend doesn't want me to go bald. Does anyone have any experience with a similar process? Any reasons for me not partake? It seems to me the worst come out will be 14 days of diarrhoea. 

This is the trial in question:

Thank you guys in advance. Any other subreddit I should cross post to?
