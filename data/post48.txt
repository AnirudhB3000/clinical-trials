Looking for services for advising on medical tourism. 38M Male 38, 6'2", 217 lbs, white.

I'm currently dealing with chronic venous insufficiency. My case is not that bad anymore, but it's my understanding this will progress, and sealing off veins early prevents progression. I've had this for about two years with improvements from weight loss, and nerves healing after the initial swelling event.

I had a bunch of vein surgeons warn me about not going to the vein clinics. I looked into them, and the vein clinics have less qualified doctors providing the treatments. I believe a US vein clinic is more likely to cause complications since it's not vascular surgeons working there. The American Society for Vascular Surgery's standard of care is conservative treatment. However, I looked up the European Society of Vascular Surgery, and their standard of care is early intervention. My grandma had this same issue, and she kept complaining about the doctors telling her to just put her feet up, until eventually decades later she had leg veins stripped.

In Europe they're even inventing newer less invasive means of sealing veins. If I go to a high quality European Clinic I believe I'm most likely to get my surface veins sealed, and stop the slight swelling in my legs in the process.  There are multiple European countries offering Sonovein, which uses sound waves to seal veins. In the US I would need to qualify for a clinical trial, and my symptoms are not severe enough to qualify. I'm most likely having to pay more for treatment or wait a couple years.

Since, the European medical system is quite large are there any services that help patients narrow down clinic selection to a more manageable range?
