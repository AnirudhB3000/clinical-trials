17F Is there any more permanent options to sleep apnea? I seriously fucking hate my cpap and it’s messing with everything in my life. i have super mild sleep apnea so none of the clinical trial stuff applies because they either want old people or more severe cases. I’m also having super bad nightmares from the sleep mask so I barely sleep anymore. I’ve been looking around to find a more discreet or surgical option because i’m going to live in a dorm soon. Im just at my breaking point. So any places to look or anything? (btw i still have my tonsils and adenoids)
