You understand me correctly. The authors interpretation (or conclusion) states median of 20 days, and not 37, with the maximum patient having detectable RNA for 24 days. And that's 24 days post disease onset, not 24 days post regression of symtoms. 

I agree that uncertainty should be handled as "better safe than sorry". But with the conclusion that detectable RNA = potential spread, you could argue that asymptomatic carriers spread infection, which has very widespread consequences that the claim does not fully support.
