I can quit any of them but coffee. I don't think that's causing it. I drink regular brewed coffee, once a day, in the morning. So I don't think that's the problem. 

You were puking blood while you were taking the antacid? Or prior? I'm asking because nothing in particular gives me actual heartburn symptoms. 
The only reason I even went to the doctor is that I was wheezing and coughing for a little while after brushing my teeth and also after even light "vaping" of THC products. I explained to my doctor that it felt like something in and around my head or throat, not my lungs, and that's how he figured it out. So I'm hopeful this is light and not that big of a deal.
