How do I get access to a "soon" to be launched new medical device?  I, \[30M\] 6' 170lbs white suffering from tinnitus for 8 years, have been following a new medical device for treating Tinnitus that is close to wrapping up its phase 2 clinical trials, let's say in April, and based on the first trial I am expecting the device to receive FDA approval sometime after that. This device is manufactured, so I'd expect limited availability initially. I would classify Tinnitus as a neurological issue, and not a hearing issue, as a result of new research resulting in this device showing it's hyperactive neurons in the brain that need to be relaxed/reset. I don't know if this is going to go through neurologists, ENTs or both..

1. How should I go about being one of the first patients to get access to the device?
2. How do I increase my odds of having insurance cover this treatment? Tinnitus is phantom ringing in the brain, and I don't know if insurance would cover something like that, especially since it's one of the #1 ailments in the USA. The Tinnitus is likely causing my chronic tension headaches & anxiety.
