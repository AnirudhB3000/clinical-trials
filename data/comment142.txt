i think this is also a kind of legal grey area. there was that lawsuit against upmc memorial last fall where a woman (darla smith) successfully sued to get her husband treated with ivermectin. the judge decided that while the hospital couldn't be forced to prescribe ivermectin, the hospital also could not prevent an independent physician from administering it.

the super sketchy "front line covid critical care alliance" (flccca) helped bring the lawsuit.
