COVID Research and the Pursuit of Evidence-Based Medicine I started out making a list of resources for my own benefit, but it's grown into something that I would like to share with others. The post below contains my most frequently referenced SARS-cov2 links and I've also added links for those interested in learning more background about the virus and how research/clinical trials work.

There's a ton of information floating around as the entire globe searches for solutions. I believe it's important for those of us in healthcare to be able to read publications and get a feel for the strengths/weaknesses of the research so that we can better draw our own conclusions. Feel free to add your own comments about research studies, links to other reddit posts regarding this subject, case reports, registries, stuff you think would make this post better etc. I'll update this post as I update my own notes.

***SARS and COVID Background:***

"COVID-19 | Coronavirus: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology | APRIL UPDATE", 47:27 min video by Ninja Nerd  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRfwZcLeOm4&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRfwZcLeOm4&t=2s)

Medium dive -  "Overview of Analytic Studies" (more about cohort studies, case control studies, pitfalls etc. Good food for thought.)  [http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713\_AnalyticOverview/index.html](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/EP/EP713_AnalyticOverview/index.html)

Book dive - *Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Made Ridiculously Simple* by Weaver et al (I found this book useful when writing up my master's thesis.  Not a free, online resource but still good to have on hand if you're an entry-level researcher and feeling overwhelmed by biostats)

Explore Integrative Medicine: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) studies (Interesting reads if you have the time. Study designs may be questionable per another reviewer, but I haven't analyzed these studies in depth. Worth a scan if you're stuck at home because what else are you going to do while in self-isolation as you await your turn to get shipped to the front lines? You already watched "Tiger King", now go learn about TCM and Shufeng Jiedu Capsules) [https://exploreim.ucla.edu/covid19/publications-on-traditional-chinese-medicine-tcm-to-treat-covid-19/](https://exploreim.ucla.edu/covid19/publications-on-traditional-chinese-medicine-tcm-to-treat-covid-19/)

“Clinical research is great and all, but my patients are dying TODAY and this doesn't help me”

I wish that I had more to offer all of you Health Care Warriors out there right now, something more substantial than website links. With that in mind I have to say this, and I apologize in advance if I sound like a mom: To all of you out there in the field, feeling like you're spinning your wheels with your COVID patients and not really getting anywhere, just know that we're all in this together and that the international effort for answers is a furious one. Even though you may feel alone and are \[choice combination of 8+ conflicting emotions at once\] or just plain numb, your hard work, clinical research-related or not, means something. We can’t tackle this without you. The whole world would be hopelessly floating up sh\*t creek without you. YOU ARE part of the collective team to handle this mess and WE ALL want you to come out on the other side of this with health intact. Don’t let your PPE precautions lax for even a moment and take care of your mental health as well. Call a friend and don’t talk about work (or do, if it helps you). Pet your cat or take a nature walk. Watch some dumb Youtube videos to get a laugh going. Meditate or Pray. Do whatever you need to do to care for yourself. I swear to Hippocrates, I’ve most likely never met you but I really do care. Please be as safe as possible.
