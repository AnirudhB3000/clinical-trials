When does a procedure in clinical trials switch to being an accepted medical practice? I am studying the use of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue in someone with heart disease.  I'm not a doctor.  My research makes it look like this is still being studied.  At what point does a procedure that's being studied suddenly switch to being something that any doctor can do?  How will I know if that's happened?  (And, does anyone know about that stem cell therapy for hearts--is that still in clinical trials?)
