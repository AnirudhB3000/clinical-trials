People will die.  And the public is going to have surprised pikachu face.  One of our outliers recently needed to intubate a patient and couldnt find “their” vent. They dont have a vent, it was loaner. IT WAS NOT THEIR VENT AND IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOSPITAL. It feels like we just stopped boarding patients in the ER and we’re going to be right back there.  


it makes me so mad. My dad and I were talking today about how we dont want to be living (more) at work. How our hospitals are likely to just force us to work the sick patients if we get sick too. Oh, youre positive? So are beds 5,7,9. Theyre yours now. (Now hopefully thats dystopian hysteria).
