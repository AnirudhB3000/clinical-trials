My (30M) GP suggested I enroll in a clinical trial he's running for a COVID vaccine. What questions do I need to be asking? Hi all. 

My general practitioner, who I've been seeing for several years and trust, also runs a clinical research center out of the same building as the doctors' offices. 

I had a virtual annual checkup today, and at the end of the call he mentioned that his clinical research center is enrolling patients for a Phase 3 trial of the Medicago COVID-19 vaccine. He said it was a viral light particle vaccine, which is a proven technology, and that the company has made vaccines before.

I think it's \[this trial\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04662697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04662697)), which is the US version of \[the Canadian trial\]([https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04636697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04636697)). 

I plan on getting a vaccine as soon as one becomes available, and I recognize that as an otherwise healthy (save being 20 pounds overweight) 30-year-old I'm low down on the list for the already approved vaccines. However, I do have some concerns:  


1) If I get a placebo, will I wind up not getting the real vaccine as early as I would have had I not joined the clinical trial?

2) If I get the real thing, what if it's not as effective as the already approved vaccines, which I may (?) no longer be eligible for?

3) I've never of Medicago before and it doesn't look like they've every gotten a vaccine approved before. They're using a new plant-based system instead of egg-based. Should I be concerned? 

4) What else do I need to be asking, to make sure it's going to be safe and I'm not going to regret waiting for Moderna/Pfizer doses to become available.   


Many thanks!
