Yes. I did back when I was a Christian. Also, most Catholics and major Protestant faiths in Western Civilization do not hold that the Creation myth is literally true, but allegorical. God didn't make the world in 7 24-hour sessions, maybe he, 7 different times, made some stuff. We don't need to assume the word "day" meant it was 24 hours. It's also very common to believe that God created all life on earth *through* evolution. No, not Intelligent Design (which is bullshit), but actual evolution. Finally, the "evidence" that the world is 6,000 years old is based on people counting how many "begats" there were in the Bible and calculating how many years had passed based on how many generations there were. It is 100% bullshit, and the extreme majority of Christians do not believe in it. The dinosaur/human cohabitation is an attempt to explain dinosaur fossils in a theory that does not include the earth existing for 4.3 billion years.
