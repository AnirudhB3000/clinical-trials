Awesome info. I appreciate your perspective and ideas. Just about everything you talked about I've encountered in one capacity or another. Definitely a lot of changes in a short amount of time. Lots to process and figure out. It will definitely be interesting to see how things pan out. But like you said, am glad they found it when they did so at least we could begin treating it. Was almost sent home with steroids and anti-inflammatories at first, would have been a real bummer.
