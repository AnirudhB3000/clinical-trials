Canada. Backwards funding model from USA. Hospitals have a budget, and they distribute it to cover universal health services. They are not for-profit institutions. They do not generally get paid any "per patient" payment from the government. It's mostly just one big pot and they figure out how to get things done and they ask for more from the government as applicable. Ecmo was one of those asks. 

This is an over simplification of course but it's more a supplies and funding allocation problem.
