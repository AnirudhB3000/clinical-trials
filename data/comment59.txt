That's the plan. Hit the chemo hard. Readjust my diet for a little while. See if something sticks. Figure there's some combo that will work. Docs can't say remission is an option but that doesn't mean its not possible. Our bodies are made to handle this bullshit, sometimes just got to back it up with a little modern medicine.
