Stage 4 lung cancer and survivability So, back in January, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer.  She's 79 years old and after a round of chemo and a clinical trial of targeted radiation to the brain, most of the tumors shrunk or are not detectable.  It had spread to her femur, liver, spine, lymph nodes and brain.

When she first got the diagnosis, most things I read said 5-11 months was the average survival time with that diagnosis.  I guess I'm just wondering if that's true or maybe outdated information.
