I don't think the person you are responding to meant it in the selfish way. I have the same question he had. As a lay person, not working in a hospital it seems REALLY bizarre that anyone entering emergency in critical condition and flu symptoms wouldn't be treated as highly infectious. But what I am hearing is hospitals DON'T do this because of a resource issue. This thread is eye opening and I think North America is screwed. I hope this information that our hospitals are completely unprepared and under resourced gets out there and fast.
