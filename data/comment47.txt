I literally just made an account to answer this. I've had POTS for most of my life and I know it's a struggle getting started with treatment, especially when there really is no one-size treatment for POTS. When I was diagnosed 2 years ago I was put on a beta blocker and a steroid called Florinef. If she's having serious low blood pressure, I would suggest getting her cardiologist to look into it. But I couldn't personally stay on it long term because it lead to extreme weight gain.

Low carb diet REALLY helps. In fact, I would say that's the number one contributor to my slow but steady recovery. Also check for any food intolerances that she may be unaware of. Take out dairy and gluten and then slowly reintroduce them to see if there's a change in symptoms. I discovered gluten is one of my top triggers for high heart rate.

If she is in bed most of the day, encourage her to sit up just a few minutes or an hour a day to build up a tolerance for an upright position. Basically a little longer than she is comfortable with it. They always tell you to exercise when you have POTS, but sometimes that's just not reasonable for where you are physically and how far it's progressed before you start treatment. Sometimes just sitting up is plenty of a workout for a POTSie heart. 

Drink lots of fluids and eat salt like candy. Gatorade is her friend and will keep her blood pressure under control. 

So see about medications like steroids and beta blockers, low carb is great and check for food intolerance, sit up as much as possible, and drink water and eat salt like it's going out of style.

There are a lot of other symptoms that go along with POTS but I feel like I've already written a book. I hope this helps!
