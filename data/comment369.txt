What did you find enlightening in it? It's a political opinion piece. This is not medical or a policy piece, it's a pop politics rant. The guy literally states as much from the first paragraph. 

It sheds absolutely no light on the CDC decision to make their own test or the **2014 FDA decision** that local testing falls under their federal jurisdiction. You guys need to stop sharing this bullshit, it's not helping.
