I mean I assume they are giving therapeutic doses ( I didn’t read the protocol). I know we did ivermectin studies at my facility early on in the pandemic and found it not helpful ( but also the study was in critically Ill icu pts and we were shooting from the hip). Not to give credence to crazy people but some countries appear to be using it effectively(?) preventatively or in early treatment but as far as I know the US hasn’t studied it that way. Hopefully this will give us some useful data one way or another
