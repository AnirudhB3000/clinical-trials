I got accused of spreading “liberal ideology” and subsequently blocked by an emergency room nurse on social media because I said that there wasn’t any good evidence that ivermectin works to treat covid. She works in a community hospital in a rural area and claimed that she knows “lots of doctors” that are using it in their practice and has “friends in research” that have evidence it works.

Of course when asked to share any publications from said “friends,” she couldn’t do it because of “censorship.”
