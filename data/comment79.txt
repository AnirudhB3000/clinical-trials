The ensure clear? My mom didnt care for them either ðŸ˜‚

My brother's shakes have whole milk, ensure plus (vanilla), and baby Multigrain cereals mixed together. That... doesnt taste great either, to be honest. He likes it, but I was kinda eh when I was curious and tried it.

Pedialyte Clear might be a good option then because as far as I am aware, it doesn't have a flavor.

The "what sounds good differs from day to day" thing was something my mom went through too. We had all that stuff around regardless, since there were more people home than just her, it would get eaten eventually. I only mentioned some of the stuff that I did because they're good sources of protein (maybe you don't need as much as she did) and are easy to quickly make for when the hunger just hits you and you can't wait for something to cook.

Have you ever frozen leftovers before? I assume there's probably a ton of people bringing you food that you're thinking, "there's no way I'll get through all this before it goes bad."

*Freeze most of everything and keep small portions in the fridge.* It doesn't take as long to reheat frozen dinners as people assume, and it will last much longer. I'm sure you've done this before, but sometimes it's nice for a reminder.

Glad to hear from you, and that the info was even slightly helpful!
