Appreciate your posting of this to generate to discussion. 

As another commenter pointed out, however, this is not a particularly nuanced account and their focus on minor lab abnormalities and tangential findings and treatment pathways that may not actually be safe (NIPPV is strictly NOT allowed at my hospital system, for instance) is distracting.

It is also untrue that viral pneumonia only rarely presents with bilateral opacity. That is characteristic of a number of viruses including the flu. Additionally, severe infleunza frequently presents with viral/stress/septic cardiomyopathy affecting both ventricles (and not just RV failure from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which is present in virtually every patient with ARDS).
