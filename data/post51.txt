ENTs, possible to get electromechanical cartilage reshaping for septum yet? 40M, 5'10", caucasian, deviated septum, no smoke/drink/drugs.

I have a deviated septum, and I'd really prefer to avoid a 2nd surgery if possible. I was thrilled to see the discovery of electromechanical reshaping (low-voltages render cartilage temporarily pliable, [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949569/)) by Brian Wong at UCLA, but have heard nothing about it since 2010.

The idea of a 20-minute outpatient procedure that doesn't involve "morselization" of part of my face is extremely appealing.

Have you heard that this is available, or in development, or in clinical trials anywhere?
