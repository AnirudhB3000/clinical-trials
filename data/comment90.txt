I’ll agree with most of your comment but “THC gets you high and CBD is the medicinal part” is an urban myth and even tiny amounts of THC have been found to make CBD treatments more effective. I don’t have a citation for that because as far as I know the science hasn’t caught up with patient led initiatives. But Leni’s Law talks about it in detail.
