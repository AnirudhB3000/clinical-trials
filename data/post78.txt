Need help with dementia treatment options Any ideas appreciated! This month I (clinical researcher and prior MRI training) have been helping my friend desperately look for help for his clearly demented (74 year old) mother (he has no other family). 

It began over the summer when she had a dizzy episode, syncope, and bad lasting headache (undiagnosed TIA?). Since then, she’s been declining rapidly and now constantly perseverates and forgets after 5 min. PCP told her to follow up in a year! I told my friend to request scans/neuro tests, and then I read through all the reports: MRI shows significant atrophy, no tau, spinal tap shows cognitive recovery in following few hours and then return to dementia, neuropsych scores are severe in learning/memory/visual, and neurology eval says “Alzheimer’s”.  

BUT she was ultimately diagnosed as “mild neurological disorder” and won’t get meds until she becomes severe. My friend said he was told there’s nothing else they can do (which is disgusting of our health care system), so I’ve been compiling lists of top neurologists and clinical trials. What else can be done for her that I’m missing?? Thank you!!
