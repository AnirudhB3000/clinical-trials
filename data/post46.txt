Mutated KRAS / Colorectal Cancer Male, caucasian/native, 37yo, 190lbs.

Is anyone familiar with functional treatment of CRC w/ KRAS mutations? 

I’m late stage 4 (Dx June, 2019) and have been on numerous chemotherapy regimens to include Xeloda, Irinotecan, oxiliplatin and avastin. The Xeloda stopped my heart (SCA with severe brain damage) on day 7 so I cannot use it anymore. The others weren’t working until I added intravenous vitamin C at 50g/ week with doxycycline. 

Can the use of enough doxy potentially have an effect on the cancer and does anyone know of clinical trials targeting CRC KRAS? The clinical trials seem to be scarce. Lumakras is working with NSCLC but I guess isn’t an option for CRC. 

Any feedback is appreciated.
