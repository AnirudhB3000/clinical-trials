No protocols.  People panicking are our bread and butter- either because they are in pain or terrified or mental health. 

At work I am a swan ( and probably in life too), I move without any sign of stress ( despite my brain spinning), I speak very slowly and calmly, with a low voice. I minimise the number of people around them, I don’t tell their relatives to be quiet- but they know quickly this is what I want. I suggest relatives have a seat if they are flapping, or say something like, “If you are calm it will help them.” 
I explain to the patient they are fine, their oxygen levels, their heart, their BP- all is well and this is just a stress reaction that will soon pass. I keep talking, about how well they are doing. I suggest they slow their breathing and close their eyes. I usually put a reassuring hand on their arm. I explain that breathing fast will make them feel worse and talk them through some slow breaths. Any progress I congratulate them on,  even if their is no progress I tell them there is great progress and well done. 
It’s a little like a game of chicken, don’t give up, don’t show fear or concern. All is well. 

If it is their first episode I explain how easy it is for this to become a learned behaviour, and how important recognising the early signs and stopping it is- it can become entrenched and disabling if allowed to.

Hope this helps- trying to think what I actually do is tricker than you’d imagine!
