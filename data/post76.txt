Osteosarcoma patient with 3.5cm enhancing left kidney mass  Hi! I'm a non-smoker 6'2" 322lbs (just weighed today at oncologist appt) male with a history of osteosarcoma. My primary tumor is osteosarcoma in the left tibia. That has been treated with limb sparing surgery and chemo. I had a couple lung mets in my left lung that were removed with surgery. My sarcoma oncologist has been monitoring a 3.5cm enhancing kidney mass that says "likely renal cell carcinoma" on the CT report. Sarcoma onco has been monitoring it because he thought I would need to be put into a clinical trial for my osteosarcoma and didn't want the RCC to disqualify me if I needed further sarcoma treatment. I'm now 2 years out from my last osteosarcoma episode so he sees it safe to refer me to a kidney oncologist. What can I expect out of this visit? Will I prob be looking at a surgery or just watch and wait?
