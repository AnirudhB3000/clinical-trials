Any existing relevant medical issues 
Diagnosed with Ovarian cancer 1a, had hysterectomy and lymph node of the right groin removed last week of September 2022, continued chemo. Cancer metastasized to other parts of the body, near lung on the right side and near heart. Was told my doctors Chemo would no long provide any benefit and was suggested home hospice while clinical trials were found. There is a follow up with an oncologist for March 28.
