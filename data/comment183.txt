Well I haven't seen one video yet where he has made quackery type comments and judging by the fact that he has important members of government talking to him (David Davies, was minister for science and technology, foreign office and so forth and recently trusted to oversee Brexit, he is one of the most influential people in the country), plus I have found his assessments on Omicron better than anyone elses with the available data and he has been found right, I think that speaks to something. He is well regarded.

Maybe he has made an error with investigating ivermectin with an open mind, but I think you have to look at what people present and make your own mind up in the end.

He is bound to have certain kinds of supporters in the comment section since he has no control over that but I don't think that changes anything in of itself.
