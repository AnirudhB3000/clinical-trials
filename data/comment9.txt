I think it's just all part of the cascade of events that occur during a "fight or flight" response. When you see blood pouring out of your veins, your (lizard) brain says: "Shit! I could die!"...and the rest is out of your control. We're all wired a little differently, so that would explain why everyone doesn't feel as you do (but you're not the first person who I've heard say this happens to them). Consider yourself fortunate -- There are far more people who totally freak out about needles, etc...so just enjoy it for what it is :).
