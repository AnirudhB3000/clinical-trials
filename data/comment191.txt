Well, sorry, I'm open to all sides and strong arguments. I fully admit and communicate what my status is and where I would be limited. But this response of yours is too hostile. I've spoken to top scientists for decades and I have never encountered this kind of hostility, they are normally humble, and I have usually very good conversation from the best ones.

If there is a thorough review or controlled trial that has sufficiently good design and large enough participants to invalidate the smaller studies, which I think is the biggest problem with most of them, also that they are not led by clinical researchers, (so I would tend to agree that they are not very strong), then of course that would be strong rebuttal and personally, I wont ever chose to take ivermectin. Its not a drug I believe works. But it should be trivial to furnish that and present that case. The confidence of people in medicine is strengthened when they see an open discussion and good, rigorous debate.

If this is the level of response, I don't think you have presented a strong argument and that's a shame, I would expect better. By all means ban me, I have no interest in discussing with such a group of people.
