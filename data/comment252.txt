I mean, on that front I can understand why it's hard. The symptoms are cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Millions of people have that set of symptoms multiple times per year. I see that literally daily in the pharmacy, covid-19 or not.

What I'm more concerned/suspicious about is the US refusing WHO test kits and then stubbornly sticking to this bizarre testing "strategy."
