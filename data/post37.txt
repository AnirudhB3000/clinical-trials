A blood clot was seen in my dad’s brain. What do we do? My dad is beginning a clinical trial for severe skin cancer. In the tests being done to get him ready to begin the trial, he got an MRI in which a small blood clot was seen in his brain. My parents are going back to the hospital next week for another MRI, lab work, etc. I have a feeling my parents aren't giving me all the info, and wondering what exactly this means and how worried I should be. Thank you in advance for any insight!
