Looking for HIE treatments/specialists.  Looking for next steps for my daughter (3, AFAB) who has hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to birth trauma. We were told in the NICU she would likely never walk or talk. She is doing well in therapy and has just begun walking, but is still nonverbal. One of our main concerns is that she has a secondary microcephaly due to the brain damage. Otherwise she is a completely healthy child, and thankfully has no seizure activity or other complications. 

We live in a rural area with limited services & subpar medical care. Her PCP has little knowledge concerning her condition and is a bit of a pain to deal with as far as getting referrals, etc. She sees a neurologist at our local children's hospital, but they think our only option is continued therapy.

I'm looking for a recommendation on a hospital, treatment center, or specific doctor that specializes in pediatric brain injuries. We've tried to get her into Boston Children's, but were told they currently aren't taking patients outside of the New England area. Money, travel, etc. is no issue for us. I'll fly her halfway across the world if anyone can point me to the best of the best. We would also be interested in clinical trials. 

We aren't convinced that therapy is our only option. It's been very beneficial for her, but as a parent it's hard to not want to do more. Several parents in Facebook groups that we are a part of are hauling their kids to Panama for stem cells, doing heavy metal purges, and other borderline quackish treatments. It's making it hard to tell what is a promising option and what is a crock of crap, so I'm hoping to find someone at the front of this field who can help her.
