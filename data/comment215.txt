I mean, really?

MyPillowGuy: "I was contacted on Easter Sunday by the administration... it's a great administration,  has had me [sic] anything I hear about out there, be it good sanitizers or cures or anything.  So this guy called me on Easter Sunday and said he had an answer to the virus.  So I reached out to my friend Secretary Carson who is on the task force and he's a doctor and he looked into it and all, got everything from the company and he said 'this is the real deal', it's been tested by over a thousand people that it's safe. Medical tests have been done..."

Cooper: Wait a minute, sir, wait a minuite, stop. There's no peer reviewed, public studies about this. There's no trials published anywhere.

MyPillowAsshatSpeakingLoudly:  "Yea, there is, Yeah there is.  There's safety tests that were done in 2016 that it was safe to take and if it's safe to take..."

....

Carson: "...you are telling people that this cures COVID.  You have no studies to prove it."

MyPillowAsshatThatApparentlyYouDidn'tHear: "You know what, I got my own study.  When I seen the test of a thousand people that it was safe, that's all i needed.  I been taking it since.... about a hundred of my friends and family.... this thing works, it's the miracle of all time."

I mean the rest of the interview is mayhem of him but he also uses the words "this thing works as a cure for everything" and that he "will save lives" and I'm tired of playing stenographer for, what I can only read, as a low effort reading into the citation/link I already provided.
