Stage 4 nsclc 31yr F no mutations or targeted therapies  Are we making right decision, wife of 1 yesrs girlfriend of 7 years is 31 diagnosed with lung cancer 2 years ago 1 year ago progressed rapidly and became stage 4 widespread liver brain abdomen spine. She currently weighs 80 pounds. Her healthy weight used to be 105. She's had a lobectomy for the lung tumor and a craniotomy for the brain tumor in the cerebellum, which is starting to come back, she's had 1st and 2nd lines of treatment cistoplatin carboplatin paxitol taxol 2 immunotherapys nothings working and doc says she's no longer a candidate for clinical trails because of her weight and energy, she said there's not much they can do, so we set up hospice, she's not bed ridden she's just really weak and in pain from the cancer. It's this the right thing to do. Do I let my wife die? Are there clinical trials for cases like hers? Being low in weight and all. This feels wrong to just let her go. We fought over 2 years, did we pick the wrong oncologist, or is this cancer just really that aggressive. I don't want to say goodbye to my best friend
