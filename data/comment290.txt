The principle diagnostic feature of this is something that is almost never seen anywhere else: bilateral viral pneumonia, usually present in all lobes.  You virtually never see that.  No reason not to set up clinical diagnosis on the basis of that alone; you could make it more stringent with white count data or something if you wanted.  A clinical confirmation would be fairly simple then.
