Aw yeah that sucks. Something to look forward to lol. Gotta find the humor or you'll go insane. I have a port for nonchemo reasons. My body rejected the PICC line because apparently my veins are like tissue. Fun times . please keep us updated on your progress . Your story really touched me and enforced why people even healthy people should go to the doctor. This may be sensitive to ask and you don't have to share but have they given you a prognosis ?
