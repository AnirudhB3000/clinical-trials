Seeking Advice: Continuing Cancer Treatment in the US vs. Italy for Ovarian Cancer (Stage 3C) Hello everyone,  
I'm reaching out to this community in hopes of gaining some insight and advice regarding my mum's ongoing battle with ovarian cancer. It's been a challenging journey, and we're at a crossroads, considering whether to pursue further treatment in the United States or continue in Europe, specifically Italy.  
Here's a brief overview of her situation:  
\- 61 years old

\- Female

\-Not overweight 

  
\- Diagnosed with stage 3C ovarian cancer.  
\- Underwent surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy.  
\- Developed chemoresistance to the initial treatment.  
\- Participated in a clinical trial targeting platinum-resistant cases with nab-paclitaxel.  
\- After six months, she was excluded from the trial due to non-responsiveness.  
\- Currently starting a new treatment regimen with gemcitabine (single agent).  
Given these developments, we're inevitably pondering if exploring treatment options in the U.S. might provide her with more advanced or different therapeutic opportunities. We're specifically looking at renowned centers such as Memorial Sloan Kettering, Mayo Clinic, and MD Anderson, known for their innovative approaches and comprehensive care in oncology.  
I would deeply appreciate any insights, experiences, or advice from those who have navigated similar decisions, especially in relation to these institutions or the general landscape of ovarian cancer treatment in the U.S. vs. Italy/Europe. Our primary goal is to ensure we're doing everything possible to fight this disease while considering the quality of life, access to cutting-edge treatments, and the logistical aspects of such a significant decision.  
Thank you in advance for your kindness and support. It means the world to us during this incredibly tough time.
