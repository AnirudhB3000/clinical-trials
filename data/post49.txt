Hey everyone, I’m doing a clinical trial pretty soon where I’ll be getting an arterial puncture in my wrist for $700 

My question is if it hurts and if so how much. I think it will be in there for quite some time. I also wonder if I’ll be able to workout the next day, assuming I heal as expected.  

I’m nervous but it’s $700 and I think it would be really fun to be able to tell people I got a needle in my artery!
