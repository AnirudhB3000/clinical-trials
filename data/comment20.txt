Last year I went to the ER with what I thought were heart palpitations, and all the signs of a classic panic attack. I would have semi-regular episodes. They couldnâ€™t find anything, and it was frustrating. They were about to discharge me with a diagnosis of anxiety. Luckily, it happened when I was hooked up to the ekg, and the nurse was out of the room. I noted the time and asked her to look at it when she returned. She showed it to the doc, and I was immediately sent for a heart cath. I now take meds for ventricular arrhythmias.
