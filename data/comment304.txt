Ignorance and apathy are the true viruses in humans. 

I was injured on the job 18 months ago, so I’m not on the front lines. I’m trying my best to educate on Facebook and spark discussion that hopefully will make people think. I wish there was more I could do. 

Very few in the Midwest are taking this seriously. They don’t think it will come, or if it does, they will call a boo boo bus and the critical access hospital will fix them right up. They have no idea that these hospitals only have one or two vents (which are probably ancient and no one knows how to use) and absolutely no ECMO. I have no idea what’s going to happen when the big hospitals fill up and the small ones have nowhere to send them. I’ve said for years we are not prepared for even a bad flu season, running on bare bones in the best of times. I was called pessimistic, an alarmist, a fear monger. 

I’d give anything to have been wrong.
