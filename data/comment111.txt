Two big studies are ACTIV-6 and COVID OUT. Results won’t be available until 2023, but hopefully they can put all of this to bed.

I am not convinced by the ivermectin data, however I do find it ironic that we still prescribe remdesevir here in the states with no second thoughts on the fact that it doesn’t work. And it only got approved because of Gilead’s initial data which have not been replicated since— hence why the WHO does not recommend it.

We should be equally dumbfounded that we are still using remdesevir.
