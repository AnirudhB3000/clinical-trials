I try not to presume intent online with no context. I do get sick of hearing it though. Americans, and our illustrious president, are so selfish that we can't let other people have some benefit even if it's neutral to, or benefits, us. This has nicely highlighted, as you said, that we're totally unprepared for this. The "what about me" crowd has successfully kept out sick leave, job protections, universal health care, and instead supported a middle man bureaucracy that's sucked trillions of dollars from patients, hospitals, and everyone who helps health care in some way. It may be out there, but it won't matter. 43% of people approve of our president right now, who can't even bother to read off a teleprompter and instead lies to the public.
