I'm sorry you are ill, and I hope you feel better quickly. And you're right, testing shouldn't affect how people behave. But it does. The issue is that too many people in the United States think exactly what you said. "How does this benefit me?" And it doesn't benefit someone to have their child's school closed for two weeks, or limit contact with other people. But it does benefit the people who would have gotten sick and lost their job, their home, their car, gone hungry with no money for food, gone bankrupt from medical bills, or died otherwise. And this is exactly why we should implement protection for people and small/medium businesses. I don't blame the person who has to go to work sick to pay the bills. I do blame a corrupt government, and every person who voted them in, that refuses to protect them.
