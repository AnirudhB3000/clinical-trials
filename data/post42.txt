Gene Therapy Unintended Side Effects 29F, 180 lbs, caucasian. Without disclosing identifying personal information, I have a congenital disease and will be on steroids for my entire life to treat it. Over a year ago, I underwent gene therapy as part of a clinical trial using the AAV5 vector. In the 9 months after the gene therapy, I was on and off tacrolimus and experienced a big decline in energy. I had bloodwork done and was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. 

I didn't respond to oral iron supplements so my pcp sent me to gastro. I had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and capsule endoscopy but nothing was found to explain the iron loss (I take continuous birth control and don't get a period).

PCP then sent me to hematology, who gave me three iron infusions. They helped, but iron is still relatively low and pcp thinks there is something else going on (she suspects malabsorption. I was tested for celiac to rule that out)

It's been a year of doctor appointments and unanswered questions but also some very big medical bills. The gene therapy trial is claiming that iron deficiency is totally unrelated to the trial. But I have gotten iron labs prior to the gene therapy and everything was normal. The timing seems very suspicious since all these issues started in the months following gene therapy. 

Can anyone think of a reason that gene therapy, tacrolimus, or even the stress to the body caused by gene therapy could trigger iron deficiency anemia? Or could gene therapy trigger something else that could cause iron deficiency? 

The trial has been very dismissive of all of this so any help from this community would be very appreciated!
