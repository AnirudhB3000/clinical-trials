c19ivermectin is a total sham.

There are several fake "meta" sites that promote some of these unproven treamtent.  They're affiliated with some of the corrupt physician groups that are making money and notoriety off of pushing these bunk claims.  The websites are set up for people who are trying to make an evidence based approach, but aren't necessarily trained in how to evaluate medical evidence.  
  
The fisher plots look all official, and they go out of their way to highlight the effect estimates (look at all that green!), but they conveniently gloss over the fact that nearly none of these studies reached statistical significance (ie, the authors were unable to confidently determine if the effect estimate was from random chance p>0.05)  
  
They also don't explain why they include so many observational and retrospective studies in their meta-analysis alongside RCTs. Or why they included other metas that included fraudulent data (the infamous Elgazzar RCT). Or why they didn't filter out the RCTs that had fatal flaws (like not testing most of the study participants for covid), or didn't include clinical endpoints.  
  
If you look at all the RCT's on this site, they're almost entirely negative. And the positive studies hardly embody confidence.
