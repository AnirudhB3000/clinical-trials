I'll have to try pear juice. Looking at lots of options regarding that matter. haha. I'll take a look at the fruit tingles. Ya, I've got to be careful when preparing food. Can turn the stomach fast. Most meals I can no longer tolerate hot. Its got to be room temp or cold. Weird. Ya, our go-to strategy is meal prep. But that was easy because I've routinely done that prior to all this. 

Thanks for the info
