Honestly, it’s late and I googled it. 

I have some severe gastro issues so metabolizing a lot of things is difficult. I’m not sure why you would contend with this specific point, knowing nothing else about my medical history. 

As I said, I can’t compare it to traditional NSAIDs so I can’t speak to what the comparison is like for others between NSAIDs and cannabis. But for anyone having severe gastric issues taking a horse pill NSAID will probably be difficult, that being said I have a hard time with edibles as well. 

Either way, sorry I can’t even focus on source searching rn.

Edit: few words
