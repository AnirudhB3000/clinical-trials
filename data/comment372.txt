I agree maximum in this case is the number to go by. You still have not addressed your claim of 37 days.

I argue that risk of spread is multifactoral, depending on virus load (high load = symptomatic, a speculation but not a wild one) and symtoms promoting droplet spread (cough, sneeze, secretion). 

RNA from retrieved sample that is being amplified (and initial amount hence in unknown) is not a good indicator for risk of spread, but rather a binary indicator of pathogen existence. Possible, in theory. Plausible? I personally doubt it. The consequences of accepting the suggested theory is VAST, and such conclusion have to be substantiated by better evidence than this.
