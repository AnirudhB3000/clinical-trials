I don't think anyone mentioned a conspiracy. It's fine if we want to reject foreign approvals and do our own. If the CDC assumed that getting clearance from the FDA would be just as slow as developing our own test and THEN getting clearance... I don't even know what to say. They can't be that fucking stupid, can they? 

I know other things went into this fiasco, like the shortage of reagents for RNA isolation (although strangely that doesn't impact other countries) and the CDC refusing to test people.
