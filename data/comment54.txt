Bugger- sorry to hear that. 
We set up behaviour loops in our brain, smoking, alcohol, eating, watching YouTube - all sorts of loops. One trigger, walking into kitchen, leads to the behaviour, opening fridge and eating. 
Some people are more susceptible to setting up these loops than others , a family history of alcoholism or anxiety or other addiction is a sign you are at risk.

The options are-
1. Avoid the whole thing starting. If you know your mum was an alcoholic (as in my case)- I am very careful about how much I drink. If you have any issue in the past- addiction, eating disorder, anxiety or panic- you know for sure you are high risk- watch for loops starting and stop them straight away before they become entrenched.

2. Early on. When you notice a pattern starting confront it- I started having a little heart race about going over a bridge near me- when it was wet and dark and I was driving fast one night the car slid- just a little and the adrenaline made my heart race. Next time it was dark on the bridge I got the heart race- even though it was fine- then I started to get the heart race even in the day. Ut oh... so I drove across that bridge backwards and forwards 20 times, I went out in the wet at night to cross it- until the fear went. 

The trouble if you leave it is it can generalise- my daughter developed a fear of dogs after an incident, then she started being afraid of cats, then any furry animal...so we bought a dog. It was tough but she got through it and now loves dogs! 

3. The behaviour is entrenched already. Start exposing yourself to the trigger for the panic in a controlled fashion. If the trigger causes you to eat- expose yourself to the trigger but in a way that prevents you from then eating. Or take medication or get therapy. For panic- Cognitive Behaviour therapy works well. You can even do it on yourself. 

Goodluck! Watch out for those loops and act fast before they become entrenched.
