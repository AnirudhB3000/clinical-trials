Your lungs have 5 sections, known a lobes, 3 on one side, 2 on the other.  Pneumonia is basically your body clogging a lobe so that gas transfer is blocked.

It's unusual to have it in both lungs, and more unusual to have it in all 5 lobes.  Thus, if testing isn't available, seeing it in all 5 lobes might be sufficient to diagnose it.
