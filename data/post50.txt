[59F] PROC patient receiving avastin+Caelyx. need recommendations for exercise routine Hello

My mother is battling platinum resistant ovarian cancer. She was on MIRASOL clinical trial, where she was showing great progress for about 4 months. Her CT scan from 6 weeks ago showed overall decrease in tumors, from 3cm to 1.1cm.  However, the recent scan revealed her cancer has regressed with additional tumor on her kidney, peritoneal thickening, and ascites. 

I can't believe this...even her blood work from 3 weeks ago showed no change in CA125 and the rest of the bloodwork compared to 6 weeks ago. Its unimaginable to think cancer can progress this fast within 3 weeks, and as hard as I try to stay calm, I'm shit scared. 

We were given choices between combining bevacizumab(avastib) with paxlitaxel or Caelyx(liposomal doxorubicin). The doctor assured either will he a good option, with paxlitaxel having slightly higher statistical success. We ultimately went with avastin+caelyx combination. 

After some research I learned avastin promotes anti-angiogenesis by inhibiting VEFG-A. My mother has been very active, and does moderate walking for about 1.5 hour everyday. I am now worried, with my limited medical knowledge, her exercise routine might promote angiogenesis which is opposite of what the drug is designed to target. 

Would it be beneficial to limit her exercise for the time being? Would moderate cardio and weights decrease the drug function? 

Thank you for reading.

Mother batteling platinum resistant ovarian cancer, progressed after 4 months of clinical trial. Now taking caelyx and avastin. Would exercise induce angiogenesis and interfere with avastins function?
