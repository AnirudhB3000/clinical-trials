Don't get me started on the social media.  I'm a nurse so my friends list is comprised of a metric shit-ton of nurses. Without exception, every single one that has posted anything about this virus is downplaying it. Sadly, same goes for the doctors I'm friends with. I hate to make it political, but I honestly think it's because I live in a rural, super conservative, Trump-loving area, and they're all defending the government's actions of late in response to this. Our schools were just closed by announcement from our Democrat governor on Friday and they're all calling it a typical "snowflake" overreaction.  Meanwhile, our store shelves are empty and everyone is out there panic buying, prepping for the end of the world. Trying to interject any science into the discussion is met with memes that purport to reveal the "truth" that the media doesn't want you to know.
