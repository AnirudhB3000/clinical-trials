PCR has been reasonably sensitive in other viral illnesses, and [here is an article discussing exactly your question of nasal versus throat in other illness.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698019/) So at least back in 2012 there's some support for NPS or at least noninferiority. 

> For coronavirus, influenza virus, EV, RSV, PIV, and HMPV, the differences among NPS, NW, and OPS were not statistically significant (Table  2). 

The concern you raise is real, of course. Maybe it's different here. Maybe technique will be a problem. I think all we really need is the highest sensitivity test here, and if that ends up being throat swab then great.
