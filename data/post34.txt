Liver ALT=1051 and AST=319. Stopped clinical trial cancer drug 2 weeks ago but numbers still went up. How can I lower it fast? I am 49yo white male, 210 pounds, 6'0" tall and have Metastatic Basal Cell Cancer. It's a very rare cancer (only 6 people in the U.S. get it every year) with no medicines to cure it. I am on a trial that consisted of me taking 2 different trial drug pills for targeted therapy. On Day 28 days with numbers of ALT=57 AST=33. On Day 42 my numbers were ALT=521 AST=185. I stopped the drugs and anything else that might hurt my liver. On Day 49 my numbers were ALT=720 AST=251 On Day 56 my numbers were ALT=1051 AST=319 I had a CT with contrast on my liver with normal results. All other blood results are fine. This is a known side effect for some people on the drug. I feel perfectly fine working two jobs and no other side effects. I need to know how to bring my liver numbers down. I am suspended from this trial for now and can't do any others until the numbers go down. I'm looking for any help!
