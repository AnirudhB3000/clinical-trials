I sorta figured, and I'm sorry it's a difficult road.  This is why our healthcare system needs fixing, people shouldn't have to be dying to get care.   
I would more so worry about getting enough protein for your body to have energy to repair tissues. Chemo is super rough on the body and well, weight loss. Getting enough calories will be your goal. So sometimes that means you don't have something healthy, but something you can keep down.   
But mostly whatever your doctor recommends.  I will be hoping the chemo kicks cancer's ass for you. You are young and fit from what I've read, and your body has an excellent chance of fighting. But , and this will be hard to hear, you should make an advance directive. I had to last year going in for a major surgery. It's something honestly everyone should have but for you it'll be something to think about. \*Internet hugs\*  


Make sure to also take care of your mental health, that can suffer with any severe illness. In person support as well as online.  I wish I could offer more help but NAD just a person who knows it can suck to be sick.
