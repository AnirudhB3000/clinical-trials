Thanks for the info. Playing with my daily nutrition a lot. What sounds appetizing can definitely change day to day. My biggest thing is maintaining a balance to preserve my health and weight. I've been doing shakes for a long time as they were a key part of my workout routine. On days I feel piss-poor vegetable/fruit juice smoothies are the best to put something on the gut. I've already got a brace of the ensures. They taste poor but they work when added to my normal protein shakes at least. But ya, It a daily experiment.
