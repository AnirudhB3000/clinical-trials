Hey all! I had consistent problems years ago with extremely painful urination and a burning sensation in the urethra at all times (while sitting, lying down, etc). It felt like I had a severe UTI all day every day. I saw multiple urology specialists and even participated in clinical trials to try to find anything that would work, but I never received a conclusive diagnosis. Blood tests, cystoscopy, urine cultures, etc. The only thing that could ever relieve the pain was Uribel (hyoscyamine, methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and sodium phosphate), and only for around 4 hours per dose. This lasted about 3.5 years.

Out of nowhere, I had a bottle of Gatorade one day. Bam -- pain gone. It took a few weeks of logging and testing things to determine that it was the Gatorade that made the difference. Ever since, I can keep the burning completely at bay by ensuring I drink at least 30 fl. oz. of Gatorade (Zero) every day. It's not a dehydration thing, because I can drink way more fl. oz. of anything else (water, soda, juice, whatever) and it will still burn. Any ideas what the Gatorade specifically is doing? My understanding is that sometimes intersex people can have problems with how much salt is concentrated in their urine, and since Gatorade is high in sodium, could that be what's happening to me?

The relief from drinking Gatorade comes within 10 minutes of having some. Just now I could feel the burning coming back, so I hit about 5 fl. oz. and it left again.
