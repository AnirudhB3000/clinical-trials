What are the highest-paid clinical trials for anxiety and avoidant personality disorder (APD?) Being from Kansas, would traveling to those clinical research centers be worth it? My age is over 21, and under 60. I'm a guy, about 5'11 to 6', weight varies but between 230-240 lbs.

I have no current medications. My mental health agency is pursuing alternative forms of treatment as I am deemed safe, for the meantime, without meds.

Now I need to know about the highest-paid clinical trials for anxiety and APD. ClinicalTrials.gov will not "sort by earnings" nor list how much each of them pay. (How come? How would it hurt to list that?)

So I need a different way to find out - either find out a more useful clinical trial search engine, or you can tell me directly if there be no better way.

Thanks in advance. Better to pursue paid clinical trials for symptoms I actually have than to pretend to be a healthy candidate when applying for a paid Phase I trial.
