I took my daughter in for her 2 week well-baby check. While listening to her heartbeat, a concerned look came over the pediatrician's face. She said nothing, left the room, and quickly returned with a thingy to put on my daughter's toe to count the beats per minute. That damn number was 304 beats per minute. She was INSTANTLY rushed to our local children's hospital where they determined she had SVT and because she was too tiny to use a defibrillator, they DUNKED her in an ice bath to shock her heart back down to normal. 

Looking back, she was pretty fussy for a few days prior. I chalked it up to being gas. Who knows how long her heart rate was that high.
